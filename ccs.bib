abstract = {Encrypting data on client-side before uploading it to a cloud storage is essential for protecting users' privacy. However client-side encryption is at odds with the standard practice of deduplication. Reconciling client-side encryption with cross-user deduplication is an active research topic. We present the first secure cross-user deduplication scheme that supports client-side encryption without requiring any additional independent servers. Interestingly, the scheme is based on using a PAKE (password authenticated key exchange) protocol. We demonstrate that our scheme provides better security guarantees than previous efforts. We show both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our scheme, via simulations using realistic datasets and an implementation.},

abstract = {Anonymity networks such as Tor are a critical privacy-enabling technology. Tor's hidden services provide both client and server anonymity. They protect the location of the server hosting the ser-vice and provide encryption at every hop from a client to the hid-den service. This paper presents CARONTE, a tool to automatically identify location leaks in hidden services, i.e., sensitive information in the content served by the hidden service or its configuration that discloses the server's IP address. Compared to prior techniques that deanonymize hidden services CARONTE implements a novel approach that does not rely on flaws on the Tor protocol and as-sumes an open-world, i.e., it does not require a short list of can-didate servers known in advance. CARONTE visits the hidden ser-vice, extracts Internet endpoints and looks up unique strings from the hidden service's content, and examines the hidden service's cer-tificate chain to extract candidate Internet endpoints where the hid-den service could be hosted. Then, it validates those candidates by connecting to them. We apply CARONTE to 1,974 hidden services, fully recovering the IP address of 101 (5{\{}{\%}{\}}) of them.},

abstract = {On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today’s OSes, less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS X and iOS. Our research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps’ sensitive data. More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services, including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS X and URL Scheme on OS X and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the App sandbox on OS X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app’s private directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed. Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of OS X and iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts on OS X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be fully addressed. We further discuss the insights from this study and the lessons learnt for building a securer system.},

abstract = {Edit distance has been proven to be an important and frequently-used metric in many human genomic research, with Similar Patient Query (SPQ) being a particularly promising and attractive exam-ple. However, due to the widespread privacy concerns on revealing personal genomic data, the scope and scale of many novel use of genome edit distance are substantially limited. While the problem of private genomic edit distance has been studied by the research community for over a decade [5], the state-of-the-art solution [30] is far from even close to be applicable to real genome sequences. In this paper, we propose several private edit distance protocols that feature unprecedentedly high efficiency and precision. Our construction is a combination of a novel genomic edit distance ap-proximation algorithm and new construction of private set differ-ence size protocols. With the private edit distance based secure SPQ primitive, we propose GENSETS, a genome-wide, privacy-preserving similar patient query system. It is able to support search-ing large-scale, distributed genome databases across the nation. We have implemented a prototype of GENSETS. The experimental re-sults show that, with 100 Mbps network connection, it would take GENSETS less than 200 minutes to search through 1 million breast cancer patients (distributed nation-wide in 250 hospitals, each hav-ing 4000 patients), based on edit distances between their genomes of lengths about 75 million nucleotides each.},

abstract = {We investigate the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as used in popular Internet protocols and find it to be less secure than widely believed. First, we present a novel flaw in TLS that allows a man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to “export-grade” Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, we implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long precomputation for a specified 512-bit group, we can compute arbitrary discrete logs in this group in minutes. We find that 82{\{}{\%}{\}} of vulnerable servers use a single 512-bit group, allowing us to compromise connections to 7{\{}{\%}{\}} of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. In response, major browsers are being changed to reject short groups. We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and 1024-bit groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are in use by millions of TLS, SSH, and VPN servers. Performing precomputations on a few of these groups would allow a passive eavesdropper to decrypt a large fraction of Internet traffic. In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency’s attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange methods should be a priority for the Internet community.},

@article{Camenisch2015,
abstract = {When data maintained in a decentralized fashion needs to be synchronized or exchanged between different databases, related data sets usually get associated with a unique iden-tifier. While this approach facilitates cross-domain data exchange, it also comes with inherent drawbacks in terms of controllability. As data records can easily be linked, no central authority can limit or control the information flow. Worse, when records contain sensitive personal data, as is for instance the case in national social security sys-tems, such linkability poses a massive security and privacy threat. An alternative approach is to use domain-specific pseudonyms, where only a central authority knows the cross-domain relation between the pseudonyms. However, current solutions require the central authority to be a fully trusted party, as otherwise it can provide false conversions and ex-ploit the data it learns from the requests. We propose an (un)linkable pseudonym system that overcomes those limi-tations, and enables controlled yet privacy-friendly exchange of distributed data. We prove our protocol secure in the UC framework and provide an efficient instantiation based on discrete-logarithm related assumptions.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the more recent Ethereum system allow users to specify scripts in transactions and con-tracts to support applications beyond simple cash transac-tions. In this work, we analyze the extent to which these systems can enforce the correct semantics of scripts. We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial com-putation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners' computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an ill-fated choice, which we call the verifier's dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de-velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com-putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap-plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two dis-tinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.},

abstract = {We show a technique to transform a linearly-homomorphic encryption into a homomorphic encryption scheme capable of evaluating degree-2 computations on ciphertexts. Our transformation is surprisingly simple and requires only one very mild property on the underlying linearly-homomorphic scheme: the message space must be a public ring in which it is possible to sample elements uniformly at random. This essentially allows us to instantiate our transformation with virtually all existing number-theoretic linearly-homomorphic schemes, such as Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier, or ElGamal. Our resulting schemes achieve circuit privacy and are compact when considering a subclass of degree-2 polynomials in which the number of additions of degree-2 terms is bounded by a constant.$\backslash$rAs an additional contribution we extend our technique to build a protocol for outsourcing computation on encrypted data using two (non-communicating) servers. Somewhat interestingly, in this case we can boost a linearly-homomorphic scheme to support the evaluation of any degree-2 polynomial while achieving full compactness.},

abstract = {Modern stealthy exploits can achieve attack goals without introducing illegal control flows, e.g., tampering with non-control data and waiting for the modified data to propa-gate and alter the control flow legally. Existing program anomaly detection systems focusing on legal control flow at-testation and short call sequence verification are inadequate to detect such stealthy attacks. In this paper, we point out the need to analyze program execution paths and discover event correlations in large-scale execution windows among millions of instructions. We propose an anomaly detection approach with two-stage machine learning algorithms to rec-ognize diverse normal call-correlation patterns and detect program attacks at both inter-and intra-cluster levels. We implement a prototype of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness against three real-world attacks and four syn-thetic anomalies with less than 0.01{\{}{\%}{\}} false positive rates and 0.1{\{}{\~{}}{\}}1.3 ms analysis overhead per behavior instance (1k to 50k function or system calls).},

@article{Shokri2015,
abstract = {Deep learning based on artificial neural networks is a very popular approach to modeling, classifying, and recognizing complex data such as images, speech, and text. The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that col- lect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents ob- vious privacy issues. Users’ personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extra-judicial surveillance. Many data own- ers—for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records—are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a practical sys- tem that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural- network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradi- ent descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models’ key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants’ models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our privacy- preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.},

@article{Mashtizadeh2015,
abstract = {Recent Pwn2Own competitions have demonstrated the continued effectiveness of control hijacking attacks despite deployed countermeasures including stack canaries and ASLR. A powerful defense called Control flow Integrity (CFI) offers a principled approach to preventing such attacks. However, prior CFI implementations use static analysis and must limit protection to remain practical. These limitations have enabled attacks against all known CFI systems, as demonstrated in recent work.   This paper presents a cryptographic approach to control flow integrity (CCFI) that is both fine-grain and practical: using message authentication codes (MAC) to protect control flow elements such as return addresses, function pointers, and vtable pointers. MACs on these elements prevent even powerful attackers with random read/write access to memory from tampering with program control flow. We implemented CCFI in Clang/LLVM, taking advantage of recently available cryptographic CPU instructions. We evaluate our system on several large software packages (including nginx, Apache and memcache) as well as all their dependencies. The cost of protection ranges from a 3-18{\%} decrease in request rate.},

abstract = {Motivated by privacy and usability requirements in various scenarios where existing cryptographic tools (like secure multi-party computation and functional encryption) are not adequate, we in- troduce a new cryptographic tool called Controlled Functional En- cryption (C-FE). As in functional encryption, C-FE allows a user (client) to learn only certain functions of encrypted data, using keys obtained from an authority. However, we allow (and require) the client to send a fresh key request to the authority every time itwants to evaluate a function on a ciphertext. We obtain efficient solu- tions by carefully combining CCA2 secure public-key encryption (or rerandomizable RCCA secure public-key encryption, depend- ing on the nature of security desired) with Yao’s garbled circuit. Our main contributions in this work include developing and for- mally defining the notion of C-FE; designing theoretical and prac- tical constructions ofC-FEschemes achieving these definitions for specific and general classes of functions; and evaluating the perfor- mance of our constructions on various application scenarios.},

@article{Balliu2014,
abstract = {Low level code is challenging: It lacks structure, it uses jumps and symbolic addresses, the control flow is often highly optimized, and registers and memory locations may be reused in ways that make typing extremely challenging. Information flow properties create additional complications: They are hyperproperties relating multiple executions, and the possibility of interrupts and concurrency, and use of devices and features like memory-mapped I/O requires a departure from the usual initial-state final-state account of noninterference. In this work we propose a novel approach to relational verification for machine code. Verification goals are expressed as equivalence of traces decorated with observation points. Relational verification conditions are propagated be- tween observation points using symbolic execution, and dis- charged using first-order reasoning. We have implemented an automated tool that integrates with SMT solvers to automate the verification task. The tool transforms ARMv7 binaries into an intermediate, architecture-independent for- mat using the BAP toolset by means of a verified translator. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tool on a separation kernel system call handler, which mixes hand-written assembly with gcc-optimized output, a UART device driver and a crypto service modular exponentiation routine.},

@article{Emms2014,
abstract = {In this paper we present an attack, which allows fraudulent transactions to be collected from EMV contactless credit and debit cards without the knowledge of the cardholder. The attack exploits a previously unreported vulnerability in EMV protocol, which allows EMV contactless cards to approve unlimited value transactions without the cardholder’s PIN when the transaction is carried out in a foreign currency. For example, we have found that Visa credit cards will approve foreign currency transactions for any amount up to €999,999.99 without the cardholder’s PIN, this side-steps the £20 contactless transaction limit in the UK. This paper outlines our analysis methodology that identified the flaw in the EMV protocol, and presents a scenario in which fraudulent transaction details are transmitted over the Internet to a “rogue merchant” who then uses the transaction data to take money from the victim’s account. In reality, the criminals would choose a value between €100 and €200, which is low enough to be within the victim’s balance and not to raise suspicion, but high enough to make each attack worthwhile. The attack is novel in that it could be operated on a large scale with multiple attackers collecting fraudulent transactions for a central rogue merchant which can be located anywhere in the world where EMV payments are accepted.},

abstract = {The Global Positioning System(GPS) is widely used in criti- cal infrastructures but is vulnerable to radio frequency (RF) interference. A common source of interference are commer- cial drivers that use GPS jammers to circumvent vehicle tracking systems. Existing mechanisms to detect and iden- tify such interference emitting vehicles on roadways require a large number of specialized detectors or a manual observa- tion process. In this paper, we design a practical, automated system to facilitate enforcement actions. Our system com- bines information from roadside monitoring points at key lo- cations along the roadway as well as mobile detectors (e.g., smartphones and other mobile GPS systems). Rather than attempting precise localization at a given time, the system exploits the inherent variation in driving speeds and the re- sulting diverging trajectories of vehicles to uniquely identify the interfering vehicle. Through our experiments on a lo- cal highway with a vehicle transmitting interference in the 900MHz ISM band, we found that the vehicle identification rate of our mechanism is 65{\{}{\%}{\}} for a single-point setup and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} for a two-point setup. We performed 200 hours of pas- sive monitoring of GPS L1 band on roadways and found two episodes of real interference. We also demonstrate that our mobile detector-based profiles are sufficiently consistent in time and space to enable reliable interference detection.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of miners to mint coins and on a peer-to-peer network to broadcast transactions. The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability. We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the bitcoin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verified. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks.},

@article{Tripp2014,
abstract = {The scale and complexity of modern software systems complicate manual security auditing. Automated analysis tools are gradually becoming a necessity. Specifically, static security analyses carry the promise of efficiently verifying large code bases. Yet, a critical usability barrier, hindering the adoption of static security analysis by developers, is the excess of false reports. Current tools do not offer the user any direct means of customizing or cleansing the re- port. The user is thus left to review hundreds, if not thousands, of potential warnings, and classify them as either actionable or spuri- ous. This is both burdensome and error prone, leaving developers disenchanted by static security checkers. We address this challenge by introducing a general technique to refine the output of static security checkers. The key idea is to apply statistical learning to the warnings output by the analysis based on user feedback on a small set of warnings. This leads to an interactive solution, whereby the user classifies a small fragment of the issues reported by the analysis, and the learning algorithm then classifies the remaining warnings automatically. An important aspect of our solution is that it is user centric. The user can express different classification policies, ranging from strong bias toward elimination of false warnings to strong bias toward preservation of true warnings, which our filtering system then executes. We have implemented our approach as the ALETHEIA tool. Our evaluation of ALETHEIA on a diversified set of nearly 4,000 client- side JavaScript benchmarks, extracted from 675 popularWeb sites, is highly encouraging. As an example, based only on 200 classi- fied warnings, and with a policy biased toward preservation of true warnings, ALETHEIA is able to boost precision by a threefold fac- tor (×2.868), while reducing recall by a negligible factor (×1.006). Other policies are enforced with a similarly high level of efficacy},

abstract = {The drastic increase of Android malware has led to a strong interest in developing methods to automate the malware analysis process. Existing automated Android malware detection and classification methods fall into two general categories: 1) signature-based and 2) machine learning-based. Signature-based approaches can be easily evaded by bytecode-level transformation attacks. Prior learning- based works extract features from application syntax, rather than program semantics, and are also subject to evasion. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-based approach that classifies An- droid malware via dependency graphs. To battle transformation attacks, we extract a weighted contextual API dependency graph as program semantics to construct feature sets. To fight against mal- ware variants and zero-day malware, we introduce graph similarity metrics to uncover homogeneous application behaviors while toler- ating minor implementation differences. We implement a prototype system, DroidSIFT, in 23 thousand lines of Java code. We evaluate our system using 2200 malware samples and 13500 benign samples. Experiments show that our signature detection can correctly label 93{\{}{\%}{\}} of malware instances; our anomaly detector is capable of detecting zero-day malware with a low false negative rate (2{\{}{\%}{\}}) and an acceptable false positive rate (5.15{\{}{\%}{\}}) for a vetting purpose.},

Our framework uses the FLUSH-RELOAD attack of Gullasch et al. as a primitive, and extends this work by leveraging it within an automaton-driven strategy for tracing a victim's execution. We leverage our framework first to confirm co-location of tenants and then to extract secrets across tenant boundaries. We specifically demonstrate attacks to collect potentially sensitive application data (e.g., the number of items in a shopping cart), to hijack user accounts, and to break SAML single sign-on. To the best of our knowledge, our attacks are the first granular, cross-tenant, side-channel attacks successfully demonstrated on state-of-the-art commercial clouds, PaaS or otherwise.},

abstract = {The popularity of mobile device has made people's lives more convenient, but threatened people's privacy at the same time. As end users are becoming more and more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even harder to track a specific user using conventional technologies. For example, cookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing UDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To address this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones using the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process. These works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to each other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie and be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like uniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to generate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the frequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies and special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear effects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to users. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone speaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information that is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify billions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype to evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can be used as a replacement of cookie.},

We exploit this observation to fingerprint smartphones through playback and recording of audio samples. We explore different acoustic features and analyze their ability to successfully fingerprint smartphones. Our experiments show that not only is it possible to fingerprint devices manufactured by different vendors but also devices that have the same maker and model; on average we were able to accurately attribute 98{\{}{\%}{\}} of all recorded audio clips from 50 different Android smartphones. Our study also identifies the prominent acoustic features capable of fingerprinting smart devices with a high success rate, and examines the effect of background noise and other variables on fingerprinting accuracy.},

abstract = {We study a model of incentivizing correct computations in a variety of cryptographic tasks. For each of these tasks we propose a formal model and design protocols satisfying our model's constraints in a hybrid model where parties have access to special ideal functionalities that enable monetary transactions. We summarize our results: • Verifiable computation. We consider a setting where a delegator outsources computation to a worker who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. We design protocols that compile both public and private verification schemes to support incentivizations described above. • Secure computation with restricted leakage. Building on the recent work of Huang et al. (Security and Privacy 2012), we show an efficient secure computation protocol that monetarily penalizes an adversary that attempts to learn one bit of information but gets detected in the process. • Fair secure computation. Inspired by recent work, we consider a model of secure computation where a party that aborts after learning the output is monetarily penalized. We then propose an ideal transaction functionality F∗ML and show a constant-round realization on the Bitcoin network. Then, in the F∗ML-hybrid world we design a constant round protocol for secure computation in this model. • Noninteractive bounties. We provide formal definitions and candidate realizations of noninteractive bounty mechanisms on the Bitcoin network which (1) allow a bounty maker to place a bounty for the solution of a hard problem by sending a single message, and (2) allow a bounty collector (unknown at the time of bounty creation) with the solution to claim the bounty, while (3) ensuring that the bounty maker can learn the solution whenever its bounty is collected, and (4) preventing malicious eavesdropping parties from both claiming the bounty as well as learning the solution. All our protocol realizations (except those realizing fair secure computation) rely on a special ideal functionality that is not currently supported in Bitcoin due to limitations imposed on Bitcoin scripts. Motivated by this, we propose validation complexity of a protocol, a formal complexity measure that captures the amount of computational effort required to validate Bitcoin transactions required to implement it in Bitcoin. Our protocols are also designed to take advantage of optimistic scenarios where participating parties behave honestly. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {The booming popularity of smartphones is partly a result of application markets where users can easily download wide range of third-party applications. However, due to the open nature of markets, especially on Android, there have been several privacy and security concerns with these applications. On Google Play, as with most other markets, users have direct access to natural-language descriptions of those applications, which give an intuitive idea of the functionality including the security-related information of those applications. Google Play also provides the permissions requested by applications to access security and privacy-sensitive APIs on the devices. Users may use such a list to evaluate the risks of using these applications. To best assist the end users, the descriptions should reflect the need for permissions, which we term description-to-permission fidelity. In this paper, we present a system AutoCog to automatically assess description-to-permission fidelity of applications. AutoCog employs state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing and our own learning-based algorithm to relate description with permissions. In our evaluation, AutoCog outperforms other related work on both performance of detection and ability of generalization over various permissions by a large extent. On an evaluation of eleven permissions, we achieve an average precision of 92.6{\{}{\%}{\}} and an average recall of 92.0{\{}{\%}{\}}. Our large-scale measurements over 45,811 applications demonstrate the severity of the problem of low description-to-permission fidelity. AutoCog helps bridge the long-lasting usability gap between security techniques and average users.},

abstract = {OAuth has become a highly influential protocol due to its swift and wide adoption in the industry. The initial objective of the protocol was specific: it serves the authorization needs for websites. What motivates our work is the realization that the protocol has been significantly re-purposed and re-targeted over the years: (1) all major identity providers, e.g., Facebook, Google and Microsoft, have re-purposed OAuth for user authentication; (2) developers have re-targeted OAuth to the mobile platforms, in addition to the traditional web platform. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary and timely to conduct an in-depth study to demystify OAuth for mobile application developers. Our work consists of two pillars: (1) an in-house study of the OAuth protocol documentation that aims to identify what might be ambiguous or unspecified for mobile developers; (2) a field-study of over 600 popular mobile applications that highlights how well developers fulfill the authentication and authorization goals in practice. The result is really worrisome: among the 149 applications that use OAuth, 89 of them (59.7{\{}{\%}{\}}) were incorrectly implemented and thus vulnerable. In the paper, we pinpoint the key portions in each OAuth protocol flow that are security critical, but are confusing or unspecified for mobile application developers. We then show several representative cases to concretely explain how real implementations fell into these pitfalls. Our findings have been communicated to vendors of the vulnerable applications. Most vendors positively confirmed the issues, and some have applied fixes. We summarize lessons learned from the study, hoping to provoke further thoughts about clear guidelines for OAuth usage in mobile applications.},

By coupling this data with demographic information for each host's primary user, such as his or her job title and level in the management hierarchy, we are able to paint a reasonably comprehensive picture of malware encounters for this enterprise. We use this analysis to build a logistic regression model for inferring the risk of hosts encountering malware; those ranked highly by our model have a >3x higher rate of encountering malware than the base rate. We also discuss where our study confirms or refutes other studies and guidance that our results suggest.},

abstract = {HTML5-based mobile apps become more and more popular, mostly because they are much easier to be ported across different mobile platforms than native apps. HTML5-based apps are implemented using the standard web technologies, including HTML5, JavaScript and CSS; they depend on some middlewares, such as PhoneGap, to interact with the underlying OS. Knowing that JavaScript is subject to code injection attacks, we have conducted a systematic study on HTML5-based mobile apps, trying to evaluate whether it is safe to rely on the web technologies for mobile app development. Our discoveries are quite surprising. We found out that if HTML5-based mobile apps become popular--it seems to go that direction based on the current projection--many of the things that we normally do today may become dangerous, including reading from 2D barcodes, scanning Wi-Fi access points, playing MP4 videos, pairing with Bluetooth devices, etc. This paper describes how HTML5-based apps can become vulnerable, how attackers can exploit their vulnerabilities through a variety of channels, and what damage can be achieved by the attackers. In addition to demonstrating the attacks through example apps, we have studied 186 PhoneGap plugins, used by apps to achieve a variety of functionalities, and we found that 11 are vulnerable. We also found two real HTML5-based apps that are vulnerable to the attacks.},

abstract = {Web search queries reveal extensive information about users’ personal lives to the search engines and Internet eavesdrop- pers. Obfuscating search queries through adding dummy queries is a practical and user-centric protection mechanism to hide users’ search intentions and interests. Despite few such obfuscation methods and tools, there is no generic quantitative methodology for evaluating users’ web-search privacy. In this paper, we provide such a methodology. We formalize adversary’s background knowledge and attacks, the users’ privacy objectives, and the algorithms to eval- uate effectiveness of query obfuscation mechanisms. We build upon machine-learning algorithms to learn the link- ability between user queries. This encompasses the adver- sary’s knowledge about the obfuscation mechanism and the users’ web-search behavior. Then, we quantify privacy of users with respect to linkage attacks. Our generic attack can run against users for which the adversary does not have any background knowledge, as well as for the cases where some prior queries from the target users are already observed. We quantify privacy at the query level (the link between user’s queries) and the semantic level (user’s topics of interest). We design a generic tool that can be used for evaluating generic obfuscationmechanisms, and users with different web search behavior. To illustrate our approach in practice, we analyze and compare privacy of users for two example obfuscation mechanisms on a set of real web-search logs.},

abstract = {T rus tZ o ne-based R ea l-time K ern el P ro tection (TZ-RKP) is a novel system that provides real-time protection of the OS kernel using the ARM TrustZone secure world. TZ-RKP is more secure than current approaches that use hypervisors to host kernel protection tools. Although hypervisors pro- vide privilege and isolation, they face fundamental security challenges due to their growing complexity and code size. TZ-RKP puts its security monitor, which represents its entire Trusted Computing Base (TCB), in the TrustZone secure world; a safe isolated environment that is dedicated to security services. Hence, the security monitor is safe from attacks that can potentially compromise the kernel, which runs in the normal world. Using the secure world for kernel protection has been crippled by the lack of control over targets that run in the normal world. TZ-RKP solves this prominent challenge using novel techniques that deprive the normal world from the ability to control certain privi- leged system functions. These functions are forced to route through the secure world for inspection and approval before being executed. TZ-RKP’s control of the normal world is non-bypassable. It can effectively stop attacks that aim at modifying or injecting kernel binaries. It can also stop at- tacks that involve modifying the system memory layout, e.g, through memory double mapping. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of TZ-RKP, which has gone through rigorous and thorough evaluation of effectiveness and performance. It is currently deployed on the latest models of the Samsung Galaxy series smart phones and tablets, which clearly demonstrates that it is a practical real-world system},

Researchers have proposed numerous attacks and defenses, and the Tor project now includes both network-and browser-level defenses against these attacks, but published defenses have high overhead, poor security, or both. This paper (1) systematically analyzes existing attacks and defenses to understand which traffic features convey the most information (and therefore are most important for defenses to hide), (2) proves lower bounds on the bandwidth costs of any defense that achieves a given level of security, (3) presents a mathematical framework for evaluating performance of fingerprinting attacks and defenses in the open-world, given their closed-world performance, and (4) presents a new defense, Tamaraw, that achieves a better security/bandwidth trade-off than any previously proposed defense. Our feature-based analysis provides clear directions to defense designers on which features need to be hidden. Our lower bounds on bandwidth costs help us understand the limits of fingerprinting defenses and to determine how close we are to "success". Our open-world/close-world connection enables researchers to perform simpler closed-world experiments and predict open-world performance.

abstract = {We propose an efficient additive homomorphic encryption scheme. In our scheme, an encryption of a message is simply its noisy modular reduction by several different moduli. The security of our scheme relies on the hardness of a new problem, the co-Approximate Common Divisor problem. We analyze its hardness by applying all known attacks and devising dedicated attacks. These analyses are not complete, but give sufficiently plausible evidence for the hardness of this new problem. Our scheme has an advantage in the performance since both of encryption and decryption consist of only several modular multiplications where a modulus is a hard-to-factor integer N or its prime factor, whereas the previous require more expensive modular exponentiations. In fact, our rudimentary implementation demonstrates that our public-key encryption scheme requires about 0.72ms, 4.00$\mu$s and 0.40$\mu$s for encryption, decryption and an addition of ciphertexts, respectively. It also takes about 40$\mu$s to compute an encryption of the mean of 1000 integers of 128-bit from their ciphertexts. To the best of our knowledge, our encryption scheme is the most efficient of those that support an additive homomorphic property. As an application of additive homomorphic encryption, we present how to efficiently evaluate a symmetric polynomial by additionally providing ciphertexts of some powers of messages. We also present a threshold version of our encryption scheme for smooth adoption of our scheme to advanced applications such as private set operations.},

We address several challenges involved in setting up the attack for the two most commonly used ad targeting mechanisms -- re-marketing and behavioral targeting. We validate the attack for one of the largest ad exchanges and empirically measure the monetary gains of the publisher by emulating the attack using web traces of 619 real users. Our results show that the attack is effective in biasing ads towards the desired higher-paying advertisers; the polluter can influence up to 74{\{}{\%}{\}} and 12{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total ad impressions for re-marketing and behavioral pollution, respectively.

abstract = {With sensitive data being increasingly stored on mobile devices and laptops, hard disk encryption is more important than ever. In particular, being able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain information is a very useful and interesting research goal. However, it has been known for some time that existing ``hidden volume'' solutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in the face of an adversary who is able to observe the contents of a disk on multiple, separate occasions. In this work, we explore more robust constructions for hidden volumes and present HIVE, which is resistant to more powerful adversaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit of this, we propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and prove HIVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HIVE, we design a new write-only Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O(1) communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user memory. This is a significant improvement over existing work and an independently interesting result. We go on to show that our write-only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume functionality with low overhead and significantly increased security. Finally, we implement HIVE as a Linux kernel block device to show both its practicality and usefulness on existing platforms.},

abstract = {Fault attacks are attacks in which an adversary with physical access to a cryptographic device, say a smartcard, tampers with the execution of an algorithm to retrieve secret material. Since the seminal Bellcore attack on modular exponentiation, there has been extensive work to discover new fault attacks against cryptographic schemes and develop countermeasures against such attacks. Originally focused on high-level algorithmic descriptions, these efforts increasingly focus on concrete implementations. While lowering the abstraction level leads to new fault attacks, it also makes their discovery significantly more challenging. In order to face this trend, it is therefore desirable to develop principled, tool-supported approaches that allow a systematic analysis of the security of cryptographic implementations against fault attacks. We propose, implement, and evaluate a new approach for finding fault attacks against cryptographic implementations. Our approach is based on identifying implementation-independent mathematical properties, or fault conditions. We choose fault conditions so that it is possible to recover secret data purely by computing on sufficiently many data points that satisfy them. Fault conditions capture the essence of a large number of attacks from the literature, including lattice-based attacks on RSA. Moreover, they provide a basis for discovering automatically new attacks: using fault conditions, we specify the problem of finding faulted implementations as a program synthesis problem. Using a specialized form of program synthesis, we discover multiple faulted attacks on RSA and ECDSA. Several of the attacks found by our tool are new, and of independent interest.},

Scenarios involving new types of devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances and wearable devices make it, however, desirable to be able to pair users' personal devices without user involvement. In this paper, we present a new approach for secure zero-interaction pairing suitable for IoT and wearable devices. We primarily require pairing to happen between "correct" devices -- the devices that the user intends to pair. Our pairing scheme identifies the correct devices based on measuring sustained co-presence over time. We do this by having the devices compute a fingerprint of their ambient context using information gathered through commonly available sensor modalities like ambient noise and luminosity. We introduce a novel robust and inexpensive approach for fingerprinting contexts over time. Co-present devices will observe roughly similar context fingerprints that we use in a key evolution protocol to gradually increase the confidence in the authenticity of the correct devices. Our experiments show the effectiveness of this approach for zero-interaction pairing.},

abstract = {People sometimes need to communicate directly with one another while concealing the communication itself. Existing systems can allow users to achieve this level of privacy in the wide-area Internet, but parties who are in close proximity (e.g., a public square or coffee shop) may want a lightweight communications channel with similar properties. Today, covert exchanges in local settings typically require the exchange of physical media or involve other forms of direct communication (e.g., conversations, blind drops); most, if not all, of these exchanges are observable: in other words, even if the message exchanges are confidential, they are not covert or deniable. We construct a local communications channel that is unobservable to everyone except the parties exchanging messages. To do so, we take advantage of the ubiquitous phenomenon of packet corruption in wireless networks, which provide deniable cover for message exchange between parties within radio range. The communicating parties use a shared secret to differentiate truly corrupted frames from those that hide messages; to other parties, messages appear as corrupted wireless frames. We tackle the challenge of designing the observable corruption patterns to ensure that an observer can neither link sender and receiver of a hidden message(unlinkability), nor determine so much as the existence of any hidden message (deniability). We present the design and implementation of a prototype system that achieves these properties using off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware, evaluate its performance, and assess its resilience to various attacks.},

abstract = {Software fault isolation (SFI) is an effective mechanism to confine untrusted modules inside isolated domains to protect their host applications. Since its debut, researchers have proposed different SFI systems for many purposes such as safe execution of untrusted native browser plugins. However, most of these systems focus on the x86 architecture. Inrecent years, ARM has become the dominant architecture for mobile devices and gains in popularity in data centers.Hence there is a compellingneed for an efficient SFI system for the ARM architecture. Unfortunately, existing systems either have prohibitively high performance overhead or place various limitations on the memory layout and instructions of untrusted modules. In this paper, we propose ARMlock, a hardware-based fault isolation for ARM. It uniquely leverages the memory domain support in ARM processors to create multiple sandboxes. Memory accesses by the untrusted module (including read, write, and execution) are strictly confined by the hardware,and instructions running inside the sandbox execute at the same speed as those outside it. ARMlock imposes virtually no structural constraints on untrusted modules. For example, they can use self-modifying code, receive exceptions, and make system calls. Moreover, system calls can be interposed by ARMlock to enforce the policies set by the host. We have implemented a prototype of ARMlock for Linux that supports the popular ARMv6 and ARMv7 sub-architecture. Our security assessment and performance measurement show that ARMlock is practical, effective, and efficient.},

abstract = {A number of recent research and industry proposals discussed using encrypted data in web applications. We first present a systematization of the design space of web applications and highlight the advantages and limitations of current proposals. Next, we present ShadowCrypt, a previously unexplored design point that enables encrypted input/output without trusting any part of the web applications. ShadowCrypt allows users to transparently switch to encrypted input/output for text-based web applications. ShadowCrypt runs as a browser extension, replacing input elements in a page with secure, isolated shadow inputs and encrypted text with secure, isolated cleartext. ShadowCrypt's key innovation is the use of Shadow DOM, an upcoming primitive that allows low-overhead isolation of DOM trees. Evaluation results indicate that ShadowCrypt has low overhead and of practical use today. Finally, based on our experience with ShadowCrypt, we present a study of 17 popular web applications, across different domains, and the functionality impact and security advantages of encrypting the data they handle.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Current app stores distribute some malware to unsuspecting users, even though the app approval process may be costly and timeconsuming. High-integrity app stores must provide stronger guarantees that their apps are not malicious. We propose a verification model for use in such app stores to guarantee that the apps are free of malicious information flows. In our model, the software vendor and the app store auditor collaborate - each does tasks that are easy for her/him, reducing overall verification cost. The software vendor provides a behavioral specification of information flow (at a finer granularity than used by current app stores) and source code annotated with information-flow type qualifiers. A flow-sensitive, context-sensitive information-flow type system checks the information flow type qualifiers in the source code and proves that only information flows in the specification can occur at run time. The app store auditor uses the vendor-provided source code to manually verify declassifications. We have implemented the information-flow type system for Android apps written in Java, and we evaluated both its effectiveness at detecting information-flow violations and its usability in practice. In an adversarial Red Team evaluation, we analyzed 72 apps (576,000 LOC) for malware. The 57 Trojans among these had been written specifically to defeat a malware analysis such as ours. Nonetheless, our information-flow type system was effective: it detected 96{\{}{\%}{\}} of malware whose malicious behavior was related to information flow and 82{\{}{\%}{\}} of all malware. In addition to the adversarial evaluation, we evaluated the practicality of using the collaborative model. The programmer annotation burden is low: 6 annotations per 100 LOC. Every sound analysis requires a human to review potential false alarms, and in our experiments, this took 30 minutes per 1,000 LOC for an auditor unfamiliar with the app. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR, is a technology for crowdsourcing statistics from end-user client software, anonymously, with strong privacy guarantees. In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

abstract = {With location-based services becoming increasingly more popular, serious concerns are being raised about the potential privacy breaches that the disclosure of location information may induce. We consider two approaches that have been proposed to limit and control the privacy loss: one is the geo-indistinguishability notion of Andr$\backslash$'es et al., which is inspired by differential privacy, and like the latter it is independent from the side knowledge of the adversary, and robust with respect to composition of attacks. The other one is the mechanism of Shokri et al., which offers an optimal trade-off between the loss of quality of service and the privacy protection with respect to a given Bayesian adversary. We show that it is possible to combine the advantages of the two approaches: given a minimum threshold for the degree of geo-indistinguishability, we construct a mechanism that offers the maximal utility, as the solution of a linear program. Thanks to the fact that geo-indistinguishability is insensitive to the remapping of a Bayesian adversary, the mechanism so constructed is optimal also in the sense of Shokri et al. Furthermore we propose a method to reduce the number of constraints of the linear program from cubic to quadratic (with respect to the number of locations), maintaining the privacy guarantees without affecting significantly the utility of the generated mechanism. This lowers considerably the time required to solve the linear program, thus enlarging significantly the size of location sets for which the optimal trade-off mechanisms can still be computed.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to conduct static analysis for security vetting of Android apps, and built a general framework, called Amandroid for determining points-to information for all objects in an Android app in a flow and context- sensitive way across Android apps components. We show that: (a) this type of comprehensive analysis is completely feasible in terms of computing resources needed with modern hardware, (b) one can easily leverage the results from this general analysis to build various types of specialized security analyses – in many cases the amount of additional coding needed is around 100 lines of code, and (c) the result of those specialized analyses leveraging Amandroid is at least on par and often exceeds prior works designed for the specific problems, which we demonstrate by comparing Amandroid’s results with those of prior works whenever we can obtain the executable of those tools. Since Amandroid’s analysis directly handles inter-component control and data flows, it can be used to address security problems that result from interactions among multiple components from either the same or different apps. Amandroid’s analysis is sound in that it can provide assurance of the absence of the specified security problems in an app with well-specified and reasonable assumptions on Android runtime system and its library.},

abstract = {Code reuse attacks allow an adversary to impose malicious behavior on an otherwise benign program. To mitigate such attacks, a common approach is to disguise the address or content of code snippets bymeans of randomization or rewrit- ing, leaving the adversary with no choice but guessing. How- ever, disclosure attacks allow an adversary to scan a process— even remotely—and enable her to read executable memory on-the-fly, thereby allowing the just-in-time assembly of ex- ploits on the target site. In this paper, we propose an approach that fundamentally thwarts the root cause of memory disclosure exploits by pre- venting the inadvertent reading of code while the code itself can still be executed. We introduce a new primitive we call Execute-no-Read (XnR) which ensures that code can still be executed by the processor, but at the same time code cannot be read as data. This ultimately forfeits the self-disassembly which is necessary for just-in-time code reuse attacks (JIT- ROP) to work. To the best of our knowledge, XnR is the first approach to prevent memory disclosure attacks of exe- cutable code and JIT-ROP attacks in general. Despite the lack of hardware support for XnR in contemporary Intel x86 and ARMprocessors, our software emulations for Linux and Windows have a run-time overhead of only 2.2{\{}{\%}{\}} and 3.4{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively.},

In this setting we can use message authentication codes (MACs) instead of public key signatures as the basis for the credential system. To this end, we construct two algebraic MACs in prime-order groups, along with efficient proto- cols for issuing credentials, asserting possession of a credential, and proving statements about hidden attributes (e.g., the age of the credential owner). We prove the security of the first scheme in the generic group model, and prove the security of the second scheme—using a dual-system-based approach—under decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH). Our MACs may be of independent interest, as they are the only uf-cmva-secure MACs with efficient proofs of knowledge. Finally, we compare the efficiency of our new systems to two existing constructions of anonymous credentials: U-Prove and Idemix. We show that the performance of the new schemes is competitive with U-Prove (which does not have multi-show unlinkability), and many times faster than Idemix.},

abstract = {Estonia was the first country in the world to use Internet voting nationally, and today more than 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of its ballots are cast online. In this paper, we analyze the security of the Estonian I-voting system based on a combination of in-person election observation, code review, and adversarial testing. Adopting a threat model that considers the advanced threats faced by a national election system—including dishonest insiders and state-sponsored attacks—we find that the I-voting system has serious architectural limitations and procedural gaps that potentially jeopardize the integrity of elections. In experimental attacks on a reproduction of the system, we demonstrate how such attackers could target the election servers or voters’ clients to alter election results or undermine the legitimacy of the system. Our findings illustrate the practical obstacles to Internet voting in the modern world, and they carry lessons for Estonia, for other countries considering adopting such systems, and for the security research community.},

abstract = {Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO) offers great potential for increasing network capacity by exploiting spatial diversity with multiple antennas. Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) further enables Access Points (APs) with multiple antennas to transmit multiple data streams concurrently to several clients. In MU-MIMO, clients need to estimate Channel State Information (CSI) and report it to APs in order to eliminate interference between them. We explore the vulnerability in clients' plaintext feedback of estimated CSI to the APs and propose two advanced attacks that malicious clients can mount by reporting forged CSI: (1) sniffing attack that enables concurrently transmitting malicious clients to eavesdrop other ongoing transmissions; (2) power attack that enables malicious clients to enhance their own capacity at the expense of others?. We have implemented and evaluated these two attacks in a WARP testbed. Based on our experimental results, we suggest a revision of the current CSI feedback scheme and propose a novel CSI feedback system, called the CSIsec, to prevent CSI forging without requiring any modification at the client side, thus facilitating its deployment.},

abstract = {The success of online social networks has attracted a constant in- terest in attacking and exploiting them. Attackers usually control malicious accounts, including both fake and compromised real user accounts, to launch attack campaigns such as social spam, malware distribution, and online rating distortion. To defend against these attacks, we design and implement a ma- licious account detection system called SynchroTrap. We observe that malicious accounts usually perform loosely synchronized ac- tions in a variety of social network context. Our system clusters user accounts according to the similarity of their actions and uncov- ers large groups of malicious accounts that act similarly at around the same time for a sustained period of time. We implement Syn- chroTrap as an incremental processing system on Hadoop and Gi- raph so that it can process the massive user activity data in a large online social network efficiently. We have deployed our system in five applications at Facebook and Instagram. SynchroTrap was able to unveil more than two million malicious accounts and 1156 large attack campaigns within one month.},

The framework explicitly addresses how user anonymity is impacted by real-life characteristics of actually deployed Tor, such as its path selection algorithm, Tor consensus data, and the preferences and the connections of the user. The anonymity assessment is based on rigorous anonymity bounds that are derived in an extension of the AnoA framework (IEEE CSF 2013). We show how to apply MATor on Tor's publicly available consensus and server descriptor data, thereby realizing the first real-time anonymity monitor. Based on experimental evaluations of this anonymity monitor on Tor Metrics data, we propose an alternative path selection algorithm that provides stronger anonymity guarantees without decreasing the overall performance of the Tor network.},

@article{Barthe2014a,
abstract = {Cache-based attacks are a class of side-channel attacks that are particularly effective in virtualized or cloud-based environments, where they have been used to recover secret keys from cryptographic implementations. One common approach to thwart cache-based attacks is to use $\backslash$emph{\{}constant-time{\}} implementations, i.e.$\backslash$, which do not branch on secrets and do not perform memory accesses that depend on secrets. However, there is no rigorous proof that constant-time implementations are protected against concurrent cache-attacks in virtualization platforms with shared cache; moreover, many prominent implementations are not constant-time. An alternative approach is to rely on system-level mechanisms. One recent such mechanism is stealth memory, which provisions a small amount of private cache for programs to carry potentially leaking computations securely. Stealth memory induces a weak form of constant-time, called $\backslash$emph{\{}S-constant-time{\}}, which encompasses some widely used cryptographic implementations. However, there is no rigorous analysis of stealth memory and S-constant-time, and no tool support for checking if applications are S-constant-time. We propose a new information-flow analysis that checks if an x86 application executes in constant-time, or in S-constant-time. Moreover, we prove that constant-time (resp. S-constant-time) programs do not leak confidential information through the cache to other operating systems executing concurrently on virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory). The soundness proofs are based on new theorems of independent interest, including isolation theorems for virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory), and proofs that constant-time implementations (resp. S-constant-time implementations) are non-interfering with respect to a strict information flow policy which disallows that control flow and memory accesses depend on secrets. We formalize our results using the $\backslash$textsf{\{}Coq{\}} proof assistant and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses on cryptographic implementations, including PolarSSL AES, DES and RC4, SHA256 and Salsa20.},

abstract = {We present Heart-to-Heart (H2H), a system to authenticate external medical device controllers and programmers to Implantable Medi- cal Devices (IMDs). IMDs, which include pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, are therapeutic medical devices partially or wholly embedded in the human body. They often have built-in radio com- munication to facilitate non-invasive reprogramming and data read- out. Many IMDs, though, lack well designed authentication proto- cols, exposing patients to over-the-air attack and physical harm. H2H makes use of ECG (heartbeat data) as an authentication mechanism, ensuring access only by a medical instrument in phys- ical contact with an IMD-bearing patient. Based on statistical anal- ysis of real-world data, we propose and analyze new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from ECG signals for use in H2H. We introduce a novel cryptographic device pairing proto- col that uses this randomness to protect against attacks by active adversaries, while meeting the practical challenges of lightweight implementation and noise tolerance in ECG readings. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation in an ARM-Cortex M-3 mi- crocontroller that demonstrates the practicality of H2H in current IMD hardware. Previous schemes have had goals much like those of H2H, but with serious limitations making them unfit for deployment—such as na{\{}{\"{\i}}{\}}vely designed cryptographic pairing protocols (some of them recently broken). In addition to its novel analysis and use of ECG entropy, H2H is the first physiologically-based IMD device pairing protocol with a rigorous adversarial model and protocol analysis.},

abstract = {We address the problem in which a client stores a large amount of data with an untrusted server in such a way that, at any moment, the client can ask the server to compute a function on some portion of its outsourced data. In this scenario, the client must be able to efficiently verify the correctness of the result despite no longer knowing the inputs of the delegated computation, it must be able to keep adding elements to its remote storage, and it does not have to fix in advance (i.e., at data outsourcing time) the function that it will delegate. Even more ambitiously, clients should be able to verify in time independent of the input-size - a very appealing property for computations over huge amounts of data. In this work we propose novel cryptographic techniques that solve the above problem for the class of computations of quadratic polynomials over a large number of variables. This class covers a wide range of significant arithmetic computations - notably, mny important statistics. To confirm the efficiency of our solution, we show encouraging performance results, e.g., correctness proofs have size below 1 kB and are verifiable by clients in less than 10 millseconds.},

We present Buddies, the first systematic design for intersection attack resistance in practical anonymity systems. Buddies groups users dynamically into buddy sets, controlling message transmission to make buddies within a set behaviorally indistinguishable under traffic analysis. To manage the inevitable tradeoffs between anonymity guarantees and communication responsiveness, Buddies enables users to select independent attack mitigation policies for each pseudonym. Using trace-based simulations and a working prototype, we find that Buddies can guarantee non-trivial anonymity set sizes in realistic chat/microblogging scenarios, for both short-lived and long-lived pseudonyms.},

Tasks are often completed by stringing together a collection of purpose-specific user applications (e.g., a barcode reader, a social networking app, a document viewer). As users direct this workflow between applications, it is difficult to predict the consequence of each step.

This paper presents Aquifer as a policy framework and system for preventing accidental information disclosure in modern operating systems. In Aquifer, application developers define secrecy restrictions that protect the entire user interface workflow defining the user task. In doing so, Aquifer provides protection beyond simple permission checks and allows applications to retain control of data even after it is shared.},

In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of a large set of DPI systems from the point of view of protocol misidentification attacks, in which adversaries on the network attempt to force the DPI to mislabel connections. Our approach uses a new cryptographic primitive called format-transforming encryption (FTE), which extends conventional symmetric encryption with the ability to transform the ciphertext into a format of our choosing. We design an FTE-based record layer that can encrypt arbitrary application-layer traffic, and we experimentally show that this forces misidentification for all of the evaluated DPI systems. This set includes a proprietary, enterprise-class DPI system used by large corporations and nation-states. We also show that using FTE as a proxy system incurs no latency overhead and as little as 16{\{}{\%}{\}} bandwidth overhead compared to standard SSH tunnels. Finally, we integrate our FTE proxy into the Tor anonymity network and demonstrate that it evades real-world censorship by the Great Firewall of China.},

abstract = {The security of any cryptosystem relies on the secrecy of the system's secret keys. Yet, recent experimental work demonstrates that tens of thousands of devices on the Internet use RSA and DSA secrets drawn from a small pool of candidate values. As a result, an adversary can derive the device's secret keys without breaking the underlying cryptosystem. We introduce a new threat model, under which there is a systemic solution to such randomness flaws. In our model, when a device generates a cryptographic key, it incorporates some random values from an entropy authority into its cryptographic secrets and then proves to the authority, using zero-knowledge-proof techniques, that it performed this operation correctly. By presenting an entropy-authority-signed public-key certificate to a third party (like a certificate authority or SSH client), the device can demonstrate that its public key incorporates randomness from the authority and is therefore drawn from a large pool of candidate values. Where possible, our protocol protects against eavesdroppers, entropy authority misbehavior, and devices attempting to discredit the entropy authority. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we have implemented and evaluated its performance on a commodity wireless home router. When running on a home router, our protocol incurs a 2.1x slowdown over conventional RSA key generation and it incurs a 4.4x slowdown over conventional EC-DSA key generation.},

abstract = {The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is widely used to secure data transfers on the Internet. Previous studies have shown that the state of non-browser SSL code is catastrophic across a large variety of desktop applications and libraries as well as a large selection of Android apps, leaving users vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks (MITMAs). To determine possible causes of SSL problems on all major appified platforms, we extended the analysis to the walled-garden ecosystem of iOS, analyzed software developer forums and conducted interviews with developers of vulnerable apps. Our results show that the root causes are not simply careless developers, but also limitations and issues of the current SSL development paradigm. Based on our findings, we derive a proposal to rethink the handling of SSL in the appified world and present a set of countermeasures to improve the handling of SSL using Android as a blueprint for other platforms. Our countermeasures prevent developers from willfully or accidentally breaking SSL certificate validation, offer support for extended features such as SSL Pinning and different SSL validation infrastructures, and protect users. We evaluated our solution against 13,500 popular Android apps and conducted developer interviews to judge the acceptance of our approach and found that our solution works well for all investigated apps and developers.},

abstract = {Devices infected with malicious software typically form bot- net armies under the influence of one or more command and control (C{\{}{\&}{\}}C) servers. The botnet problem reached such levels where federal law enforcement agencies have to step in and take actions against botnets by disrupting (or“taking down”) their C{\{}{\&}{\}}Cs, and thus their illicit operations. Lately, more and more private companies have started to indepen- dently take action against botnet armies, primarily focusing on their DNS-based C{\{}{\&}{\}}Cs. While well-intentioned, their C{\{}{\&}{\}}C takedown methodology is in most cases ad-hoc, and limited by the breadth of knowledge available around the malware that facilitates the botnet. With this paper, we aim to bring order, measure, and reason to the botnet takedown problem. We propose a takedown analysis and recommendation system, called rza, that allows researchers to perform two tasks: 1) a post- mortem analysis of past botnet takedowns, and 2) provide recommendations on how to successfully execute future bot- net takedowns. As part of our system evaluation, we per- form a postmortem analysis of the recent Kelihos, Zeus and 3322.org takedowns. We show that while some of these take- downs were effective, others did not appear to have a signif- icant long-term impact on the targeted botnet. In addition to the postmortem analyses, we provide takedown recom- mendation metrics for 45 currently active botnets, where we find that 42 of them can likely be disabled entirely by using a DNS-based takedown strategy only},

abstract = {The smartphone market has grown explosively in recent years, as more and more consumers are attracted to the sensor-studded mul- tipurpose devices. Android is particularly ascendant; as an open platform, smartphone manufacturers are free to extend and modify it, allowing them to differentiate themselves from their competitors. However, vendor customizations will inherently impact overall An- droid security and such impact is still largely unknown. In this paper, we analyze ten representative stock Android im- ages from ﬁve popular smartphone vendors (with two models from each vendor). Our goal is to assess the extent of security issues that may be introduced from vendor customizations and further de- termine how the situation is evolving over time. In particular, we take a three-stage process: First, given a smartphone’s stock im- age, we perform provenance analysis to classify each app in the image into three categories: apps originating from the AOSP, apps customized or written by the vendor, and third-party apps that are simply bundled into the stock image. Such provenance analysis allows for proper attribution of detected security issues in the ex- amined Android images. Second, we analyze permission usages of pre-loaded apps to identify overprivileged ones that unnecessarily request more Android permissions than they actually use. Finally, in vulnerability analysis, we detect buggy pre-loaded apps that can be exploited to mount permission re-delegation attacks or leak pri- vate information. Our evaluation results are worrisome: vendor customizations are signiﬁcant on stock Android devices and on the whole responsible for the bulk of the security problems we detected in each device. Speciﬁcally, our results show that on average 85.78{\{}{\%}{\}} of all pre- loaded apps in examined stock images are overprivileged with a majority of them directly from vendor customizations. In addition, 64.71{\{}{\%}{\}} to 85.00{\{}{\%}{\}} of vulnerabilities we detected in examined im- ages from every vendor (except for Sony) arose from vendor cus- tomizations. In general, this pattern held over time – newer smart- phones, we found, are not necessarily more secure than older ones.},

By using a mix of real and dummy contacts, one can camouflage a standard cell whose functionality can be one of many. If an attacker cannot resolve the functionality of a camouflaged gate, he/she will extract an incorrect netlist. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of identifying the functionality of camouflaged gates. We also propose techniques to make the dummy contact-based IC camouflaging technique resilient to reverse engineering. Furthermore, we judiciously select gates to camouflage by using techniques which ensure that the outputs of the extracted netlist are controllably corrupted. The techniques leverage IC testing principles such as justification and sensitization. The proposed techniques are evaluated using ISCAS benchmark circuits and OpenSparc T1 microprocessor controllers. © 2013 ACM.},

In this paper, we present Viceroi, a principled approach to catching click-spam in search ad networks. It is designed based on the intuition that click-spam is a profit-making business that needs to deliver higher return on investment (ROI) for click-spammers than other (ethical) businessmod- els to offset the risk of getting caught. Viceroi operates at the ad network where it has visibility into all ad clicks. Working with a large real-world ad network, we find that the simple-yet-generalViceroi approach catches over six very different classes of click-spam attacks (e.g., malware-driven, search-hijacking, arbitrage) without any tuning knobs.

Previous work focused on detecting if a web site is malicious by dynamically executing JavaScript in instrumented environments or by rendering web sites in client honeypots. Both techniques bear a significant evaluation overhead, since the analysis can take up to tens of seconds or even minutes per sample. In this paper, we introduce a novel, purely static analy- sis approach, the ∆-system, that (i) extracts change-related features between two versions of the same website, (ii) uses a machine-learning algorithm to derive a model of web site changes, (iii) detects if a change was malicious or benign, (iv) identifies the underlying infection vector campaign based on clustering, and (iv) generates an identifying signature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the ∆-system by eval- uating it on a dataset of over 26 million pairs of web sites by running next to a web crawler for a period of fourmonths. Over this time span, the ∆-system successfully identified previously unknown infection campaigns.

We demonstrate that even with perfect emulation of the cover channel, these systems can be vulnerable to attacks that detect or disrupt the covert communica- tions while having no effect on legitimate cover traffic. Our attacks stem from differences in the channel requirements for the cover protocols, which are peer-to-peer and loss tolerant, and the covert traffic, which is client-proxy and loss intolerant.

In all performance evaluations of touch-based authentication systems however, researchers have assumed naive (zero-effort) forgeries in which the attacker makes no effort to mimic a given gesture pattern. In this paper we demonstrate that a simple "Lego" robot driven by input gleaned from general population swiping statistics can generate forgeries that achieve alarmingly high penetration rates against touch-based authentication systems. Using the best classification algorithms in touch-based authentication, we rigorously explore the effect of the attack, finding that it increases the Equal Error Rates of the classifiers by between 339{\{}{\%}{\}} and 1004{\{}{\%}{\}} depending on parameters such as the failure-to-enroll threshold and the type of touch stroke generated by the robot.

In this paper, we strive to improve this situation by accelerating the process of manual auditing. We introduce Chucky, a method to expose missing checks in source code. Many vulnerabilities result from insufficient input validation and thus omitted or false checks provide valuable clues for finding security flaws. Our method proceeds by statically tainting source code and identifying anomalous or missing conditions linked to security-critical objects.In an empirical evaluation with five popular open-source projects, Chucky is able to accurately identify artificial and real missing checks, which ultimately enables us to uncover 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities in two of the projects (Pidgin and LibTIFF).},

abstract = {Password-based authentication is the dominant form of access control in web services. Unfortunately, it proves to be more and more inadequate every year. Even if users choose long and complex passwords, vulnerabilities in the way they are managed by a service may leak them to an attacker. Recent incidents in popular services such as LinkedIn and Twitter demonstrate the impact that such an event could have. The use of one-way hash functions to mitigate the problem is countered by the evolution of hardware which enables powerful password-cracking platforms. In this paper we propose SAuth, a protocol which employs authentication synergy among different services. Users wishing to access their account on service S will also have to authenticate for their account on service V , which acts as a vouching party. Both services S and V are regular sites visited by the user everyday (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Gmail). Should an attacker acquire the password for service S he will be unable to log in unless he also compromises the password for service V and possibly more vouching services. SAuth is an extension and not a replacement of existing authentication methods. It operates one layer above without ties to a specific method, thus enabling different services to employ heterogeneous systems. Finally we employ password decoys to protect users that share a password across services.},

abstract = {Graphical passwords were proposed as an alternative to over- come the inherent limitations of text-based passwords, in- spired by research that shows that the graphical memory of humans is particularly well developed. A graphical password scheme that has been widely adopted is the Android Unlock Pattern, a special case of the Pass-Go scheme with grid size restricted to 3×3 points and restricted stroke count. In this paper, we study the security of Android unlock pat- terns. By performing a large-scale user study, we measure actual user choices of patterns instead of theoretical consid- erations on password spaces. From this data we construct a model based on Markov chains that enables us to quantify the strength of Android unlock patterns. We found empiri- cally that there is a high bias in the pattern selection process, e. g., the upper left corner and three-point long straight lines are very typical selection strategies. Consequently, the en- tropy of patterns is rather low, and our results indicate that the security offered by the scheme is less than the security of only three digit randomly-assigned PINs for guessing 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of all passwords (i. e., we estimate a partial guessing entropy G0.2 of 9.10 bit). Based on these insights, we systematically improve the scheme by finding a small, but still effective change in the pattern layout that makes graphical user logins substantially more secure. By means of another user study, we show that some changes improve the security by more than doubling the space of actually used passwords (i. e., increasing the partial guessing entropy G0.2 to 10.81 bit).},

@article{Dodis2013,
abstract = {A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm that produces numbers whose distribution is indistinguishable from uniform. A formal security model for PRNGs with input was proposed in 2005 by Barak and Halevi (BH). This model involves an internal state that is refreshed with a (potentially biased) external random source, and a cryptographic function that outputs random numbers from the continually internal state. In this work we extend the BH model to also include a new security property capturing how it should accumulate the entropy of the input data into the internal state after state compromise. This property states that a good PRNG should be able to eventually recover from compromise even if the entropy is injected into the system at a very slow pace, and expresses the real-life expected behavior of existing PRNG designs. Unfortunately, we show that neither the model nor the specific PRNG construction proposed by Barak and Halevi meet this new property, despite meeting a weaker robustness notion introduced by BH. From a practical side, we also give a precise assessment of the security of the two Linux PRNGs, /dev/random and /dev/urandom. In particular, we show several attacks proving that these PRNGs are not robust according to our definition, and do not accumulate entropy properly. These attacks are due to the vulnerabilities of the entropy estimator and the internal mixing function of the Linux PRNGs. These attacks against the Linux PRNG show that it does not satisfy the "robustness" notion of security, but it remains unclear if these attacks lead to actual exploitable vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we propose a simple and very efficient PRNG construction that is provably robust in our new and stronger adversarial model. We present benchmarks between this construction and the Linux PRNG that show that this contruction is on average more efficient when recovering from a compromised internal state and when generating cryptographic keys. We therefore recommend to use this construction whenever a PRNG with input is used for cryptography. Keywords:},

abstract = {The web is one of the most popular vectors to spread malware. Attackers lure victims to visit compromised web pages or entice them to click on malicious links. These victims are redirected to sites that exploit their browsers or trick them into installing malicious software using social engineering. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting malicious web pages from a novel angle. Instead of looking at particular features of a (malicious) web page, we analyze how a large and diverse set of web browsers reach these pages. That is, we use the browsers of a collection of web users to record their interactions with websites, as well as the redirections they go through to reach their final destinations. We then aggregate the different redirection chains that lead to a specific web page and analyze the characteristics of the resulting redirection graph. As we will show, these characteristics can be used to detect malicious pages. We argue that our approach is less prone to evasion than previous systems, allows us to also detect scam pages that rely on social engineering rather than only those that exploit browser vulnerabilities, and can be implemented efficiently. We developed a system, called SpiderWeb, which implements our proposed approach. We show that this system works well in detecting web pages that deliver malware.},

We analyze and report on feedback from 22 of these educators about their experiences using Control-Alt-Hack with over 450 students in classroom and non-classroom contexts. The responses from the 14 educators who reported on their use of the game in a classroom context variously indicated that: their students' awareness of computer security as a complex and interesting field was increased (11/14); they would use the game again in their classroom (10/14); and they would recommend the game to others (13/14). Of note, 2 of the 14 classroom educators reported that they would not have otherwise covered the material. Additionally, we present results from user studies with 11 individuals and find that their responses indicate that 8 of the 11 had an increased awareness of computer security or a changed perception; furthermore, all of our intended goals are touched upon in their responses.},

abstract = {With over 1.6 billion debit and credit cards in use worldwide, the EMV system (a.k.a. "Chip-and-PIN") has become one of the most important deployed cryptographic protocol suites. Recently, the EMV consortium has decided to upgrade the existing RSA based system with a new system relying on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). One of the central components of the new system is a protocol that enables a card to establish a secure channel with a card reader. In this paper we provide a security analysis of the proposed protocol, we propose minor changes/clarifications to the "Request for Comments" issued in Nov 2012, and demonstrate that the resulting protocol meets the intended security goals. The structure of the protocol is one commonly encountered in practice: first run a key-exchange to establish a shared key (which performs authentication and key confirmation), only then use the channel to exchange application messages. Although common in practice, this structure takes the protocol out of the reach of most standard security models for key-exchange. Unfortunately, the only models that can cope with the above structure suffer from some drawbacks that make them unsuitable for our analysis. Our second contribution is to provide new security models for channel establishment protocols. Our models have a more inclusive syntax, are quite general, deal with a realistic notion of authentication (one-sided authentication as required by EMV), and do not suffer from the drawbacks that we identify in prior models. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Of late, threats enabled by the ubiquitous use of mobile devices have drawn much interest from the research community. However, prior threats all suffer from a similar, and profound, weakness - namely the requirement that the adversary is either within visual range of the victim (e.g., to ensure that the pop-out events in reflections in the victim's sunglasses can be discerned) or is close enough to the target to avoid the use of expensive telescopes. In this paper, we broaden the scope of the attacks by relaxing these requirements and show that breaches of privacy are possible even when the adversary is around a corner. The approach we take overcomes challenges posed by low image resolution by extending computer vision methods to operate on small, high-noise, images. Moreover, our work is applicable to all types of keyboards because of a novel application of fingertip motion analysis for key-press detection. In doing so, we are also able to exploit reflections in the eyeball of the user or even repeated reflections (i.e., a reflection of a reflection of the mobile device in the eyeball of the user). Our empirical results show that we can perform these attacks with high accuracy, and can do so in scenarios that aptly demonstrate the realism of this threat.},

abstract = {Android phones often carry personal information, attracting malicious developers to embed code in Android applications to steal sensitive data. With known techniques in the literature, one may easily determine if sensitive data is being transmitted out of an Android phone. However, transmission of sensitive data in itself does not necessarily indicate privacy leakage; a better indicator may be whether the transmission is by user intention or not. When transmission is not intended by the user, it is more likely a privacy leakage. The problem is how to determine if transmission is user intended. As a first solution in this space, we present a new analysis framework called AppIntent. For each data transmission, AppIntent can efficiently provide a sequence of GUI manipulations corresponding to the sequence of events that lead to the data transmission, thus helping an analyst to determine if the data transmission is user intended or not. The basic idea is to use symbolic execution to generate the aforementioned event sequence, but straightforward symbolic execution proves to be too time-consuming to be practical. A major innovation in AppIntent is to leverage the unique Android execution model to reduce the search space without sacrificing code coverage. We also present an evaluation of AppIntent with a set of 750 malicious apps, as well as 1,000 top free apps from Google Play. The results show that AppIntent can effectively help separate the apps that truly leak user privacy from those that do not.},

abstract = {Hardware design today bears similarities to software design. Often vendors buy and integrate code acquired from third-party organizations into their designs, especially in embedded/system-on-chip designs. Currently, there is no way to determine if third-party designs have built-in backdoors that can compromise security after deployment. The key observation we use to approach this problem is that hardware backdoors incorporate logic that is nearly-unused, i.e. stealthy. The wires used in stealthy backdoor circuits almost never influence the outputs of those circuits. Typically, they do so only when triggered using external inputs from an attacker. In this paper, we present FANCI, a tool that flags suspicious wires, in a design, which have the potential to be malicious. FANCI uses scalable, approximate, boolean functional analysis to detect these wires. Our examination of the TrustHub hardware backdoor benchmark suite shows that FANCI is able to flag all suspicious paths in the benchmarks that are associated with backdoors. Unlike prior work in the area, FANCI is not hindered by incomplete test suite coverage and thus is able to operate in practice without false negatives. Furthermore, FANCI reports low false positive rates: less than 1{\{}{\%}{\}} of wires are reported as suspicious in most cases. All TrustHub designs were analyzed in a day or less. We also analyze a backdoor-free out-of-order microprocessor core to demonstrate applicability beyond benchmarks.},

abstract = {Modern client platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 8, have progressed from a per-user isolation policy, where users are isolated but a user's applications run in the same isolation container, to an application isolation policy, where different applications are isolated from one another. However, this is not enough because mutually distrusting content can interfere with one another inside a single application. For example, an attacker-crafted image may compromise a photo editor application and steal other images processed by the editor. In this paper, we advocate a content-based principal model in which the OS treats content owners as its principals and isolates content of different owners from one another. Our key contribution is to generalize the content-based principal model from web browsers, namely, the same-origin policy, into an isolation policy that is suitable for all applications. The key challenge we faced is to support flexible isolation granularities while remaining compatible with the web. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of our prototype system that tackles this challenge.},

abstract = {Electronic locking systems are rather new products in the physical access control market. In contrast to mechanical locking systems, they provide several convenient features such as a more flexible access rights management, the pos- sibility to revoke physical keys and the claim that electronic keys can not be cloned as easily as their mechanical coun- terparts. Features like these make electronic locking sys- tems especially attractive to office and industry buildings with many locks and keys being used. For such buildings, situations like the necessity to grant custom-tailored access rights to individuals, the danger of key loss or the fluctua- tion of employees often cannot be handled with conventional locking systems than with electronic ones. While for some electronic locks, mechanical flaws had been found [1], only few publications analyzed the cryptographic security of elec- tronic locking systems. [2] In this paper, we analyzed the electronic security of an electronic locking system which is widely deployed in the field. While we consider the system to be well-designed, we discovered some implementation flaws which eventually allow the generation of a system-wide mas- ter key by either having physical access to any key in the system or by intercepting two door opening procedures},

abstract = {OpenSSL is the most widely used library for SSL/TLS on the Android platform. The security of OpenSSL depends greatly on the unpredictability of its Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). In this paper, we reveal the vulnerability of the OpenSSL PRNG on the Android. We first analyze the architecture of the OpenSSL specific to Android, and the overall operation process of the PRNG from initialization until the session key is generated. Owing to the nature of Android, the Dalvik Virtual Machine in Zygote initializes the states of OpenSSL PRNG early upon booting, and SSL applications copy the PRNG states of Zygote when they start. Therefore, the applications that use OpenSSL generate random data from the same initial states, which is potential problem that may seriously affect the security of Android applications. Next, we investigate the possibility of recovering the initial states of the OpenSSL PRNG. To do so, we should predict the nine external entropy sources of the PRNG. However, we show that these sources can be obtained in practice if the device is fixed. For example, the complexity of the attack was O(2{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}32+t{\{}{\}}{\}}) in our smartphone, where t is the bit complexity for estimating the system boot time. In our experiments, we were able to restore the PRNG states in 74 out of 100 cases. Assuming that we knew the boot time, i.e., t=0, the average time required to restore was 35 min on a PC with four cores (eight threads). Finally, we show that it is possible to recover the PreMasterSecret of the first SSL session with O(2{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}58{\{}{\}}{\}}) computations using the restored PRNG states, if the application is implemented by utilizing org.webkit package and a key exchange scheme is RSA. It shows that the vulnerability of OpenSSL PRNG can be a real threat to the security of Android.},

abstract = {{\{}Secure computation on private data has been an active area of research for many years and has received a renewed interest with the emergence of cloud computing. In recent years, substantial progress has been made with respect to the efficiency of the available techniques and several implementations have appeared. The available tools, however, lacked a convenient mechanism for implementing a general-purpose{\{}{\}}{\}}program in a secure computation framework suitable for execution in not fully trusted environments. This work fulfills this gap and describes a system, called PICCO, for converting a program written in an extension of C into its distributed secure implementation and running it in a distributed environment. The C extension preserves all current features of the programming language and allows variables to be marked as private and be used in general-purpose computation. Secure distributed implementation of compiled programs is based on linear secret sharing, achieving efficiency and information-theoretical security. Our experiments also indicate that many programs can be evaluated very efficiently on private data using PICCO. © 2013 ACM.},

Despite a wave of public discoveries of such backdoors over the last few years, this threat has only rarely been tackled so far. In this paper, we present an approach to reduce the attack surface for this kind of attacks and we strive for an automated identification and elimination of backdoors in binary applications. We limit our focus on the examination of server applications within a client-server model. At the core, we apply variations of the delta debugging technique and introduce several novel heuristics for the identification of those regions in binary application that backdoors are typically installed in (i.e., authentication and command processing functions). We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach on several real-world backdoors found in modified versions of the popular software tools ProFTPD and OpenSSH. Furthermore, we evaluate our implementation not only on common instruction set architectures such as x86-64, but also on commercial off-the-shelf embedded devices powered by a MIPS32 processor.},

In this paper we extend previous work by considering a more powerful and general adversary model, a new analysis method based on sensitivity functions, and by proposing several countermeasures that can mitigate the negative impact of these attacks. Countermeasures include adding a low-pass filter to the pricing signals, selecting the time interval between price updates, selecting parameters of the controller, designing robust control algorithms, and by detecting anomalies in the behavior of the system.},

abstract = {Just-in-time compilers (JITs) are here to stay. Unfortunately, they also provide new capabilities to cyber attackers, namely the ability to supply input programs (in languages such as JavaScript) that will then be compiled to executable code. Once this code is placed and marked as executable, it can then be leveraged by the attacker. Randomization techniques such as constant blinding raise the cost to the attacker, but they significantly add to the burden of implementing a JIT. There are a great many JITs in use today, but not even all of the most commonly used ones randomize their outputs. We present librando, the first comprehensive technique to harden JIT compilers in a completely generic manner by randomizing their output transparently ex post facto. We implement this approach as a system-wide service that can simultaneously harden multiple running JITs. It hooks into the memory protections of the target OS and randomizes newly generated code on the fly when marked as executable. In order to provide “black box” JIT hardening, librando needs to be extremely conservative. For example, it completely preserves the contents of the calling stack, presenting each JIT with the illusion that it is executing its own generated code. Yet in spite of the heavy lifting that librando performs behind the scenes, the performance impact is surprisingly low. For Java (HotSpot), we measured slow- downs by a factor of 1.15×, and for compute-intensive JavaScript (V8) benchmarks, a slowdown of 3.5×. For many applications, this overhead},

abstract = {Referencing outside the bounds of an array or buffer is a common source of bugs and security vulnerabilities in today's software. We can enforce spatial safety and eliminate these violations by inseparably associating bounds with every pointer (fat pointer) and checking these bounds on every memory access. By further adding hardware-managed tags to the pointer, we make them unforgeable. This, in turn, allows the pointers to be used as capabilities to facilitate fine-grained access control and fast security domain crossing. Dedicated checking hardware runs in parallel with the processor's normal datapath so that the checks do not slow down processor operation (0{\{}{\%}{\}} runtime overhead). To achieve the safety of fat pointers without increasing program state, we compactly encode approximate base and bound pointers along with exact address pointers for a 46b address space into one 64-bit word with a worst-case memory overhead of 3{\{}{\%}{\}}. We develop gate-level implementations of the logic for updating and validating these compact fat pointers and show that the hardware requirements are low and the critical paths for common operations are smaller than processor ALU operations. Specifically, we show that the fat-pointer check and update operations can run in a 4 ns clock cycle on a Virtex 6 (40nm) implementation while only using 1100 6-LUTs or about the area of a double-precision, floating-point adder.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

abstract = {Smart grid deployment initiatives have been witnessed in the past recent years. Smart grids provide bi-directional communication between meters and headend system through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need of tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for the smart grid, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grid exhibits deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to develop intrusion detection system. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. Event logs are modeled using fourth order Markov Chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks, however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.},

abstract = {Android platform adopts permissions to protect sensitive resources from untrusted apps. However, after permissions are granted by users at install time, apps could use these permissions (sensitive resources) with no further restrictions. Thus, recent years have witnessed the explosion of undesirable behaviors in Android apps. An important part in the defense is the accurate analysis of Android apps. However, traditional syscall-based analysis techniques are not well-suited for Android, because they could not capture critical interactions between the application and the Android system. This paper presents VetDroid, a dynamic analysis platform for reconstructing sensitive behaviors in Android apps from a novel permission use perspective. VetDroid features a systematic framework to effectively construct permission use behaviors, i.e., how applications use permissions to access (sensitive) system resources, and how these acquired permission-sensitive resources are further utilized by the application. With permission use behaviors, security analysts can easily examine the internal sensitive behaviors of an app. Using real-world Android malware, we show that VetDroid can clearly reconstruct fine-grained malicious behaviors to ease malware analysis. We further apply VetDroid to 1,249 top free apps in Google Play. VetDroid can assist in finding more information leaks than TaintDroid, a state-of-the-art technique. In addition, we show how we can use VetDroid to analyze fine-grained causes of information leaks that TaintDroid cannot reveal. Finally, we show that VetDroid can help identify subtle vulnerabilities in some (top free) applications otherwise hard to detect.},

abstract = {We introduce PHANTOM [1] a new secure processor that obfuscates its memory access trace. To an adversary who can observe the processor's output pins, all memory access traces are computationally indistinguishable (a property known as obliviousness). We achieve obliviousness through a cryptographic construct known as Oblivious RAM or ORAM. We first improve an existing ORAM algorithm and construct an empirical model for its trusted storage requirement. We then present PHANTOM, an oblivious processor whose novel memory controller aggressively exploits DRAM bank parallelism to reduce ORAM access latency and scales well to a large number of memory channels. Finally, we build a complete hardware implementation of PHANTOM on a commercially available FPGA-based server, and through detailed experiments show that PHANTOM is efficient in both area and performance. Accessing 4KB of data from a 1GB ORAM takes 26.2us (13.5us for the data to be available), a 32x slowdown over accessing 4KB from regular memory, while SQLite queries on a population database see 1.2-6x slowdown. PHANTOM is the first demonstration of a practical, oblivious processor and can provide strong confidentiality guarantees when offloading computation to the cloud.},

abstract = {Back in 2007, Hasegawa discovered a novel Cross-Site Scrip- ting (XSS) vector based on the mistreatment of the backtick character in a single browser implementation. This initially looked like an implementation error that could easily be fixed. Instead, as this paper shows, it was the first example of a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML and related properties. mXSS affects all three major browser families: IE, Firefox, and Chrome. We were able to place stored mXSS vectors in high-profile applications like Yahoo! Mail, Rediff Mail, OpenExchange, Zimbra, Roundcube, and several commercial products. m- XSS vectors bypassed widely deployed server-side XSS pro- tection techniques (like HTML Purifier, kses, htmlLawed, Blueprint and Google Caja), client-side filters (XSSAuditor, IE XSS Filter), Web Application Firewall (WAF) systems, as well as Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Sys- tems (IDS/IPS).We describe a scenario in which seemingly immune entities are being rendered prone to an attack based on the behavior of an involved party, in our case the browser. Moreover, it proves very difficult to mitigate these attacks: In browser implementations, mXSS is closely related to per- formance enhancements applied to the HTML code before rendering; in server side filters, strict filter rules would break many web applications since the mXSS vectors presented in this paper are harmless when sent to the browser. This paper introduces and discusses a set of seven differ- ent subclasses of mXSS attacks, among which only one was previously known. The work evaluates the attack surface, showcases examples of vulnerable high-profile applications, and provides a set of practicable and low-overhead solutions to defend against these kinds of attacks.

Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior efficient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security.},

In this paper, we propose a new abstraction, called CRYPTON, which supports intra-origin control over sensitive data throughout its life cycle. To securely enforce the semantics of CRYPTONs, we develop a standalone component called CRYPTON-KERNEL, which extensively leverages the func- tionality of existing web browsers without relying on their large TCB. Our evaluation demonstrates that the CRYPTON abstraction supported by the CRYPTON-KERNEL is widely applicable to pop- ular real-world applications with millions of users, including web- mail, chat, blog applications, and Alexa Top 50 websites, with low performance overhead.},

abstract = {The practical application of Secure Two-Party Computation is hindered by the difficulty to implement secure computation protocols. While recent work has proposed very simple programming languages which can be used to specify secure computations, it is still difficult for practitioners to use them, and cumbersome to translate existing source code into this format. Similarly, the manual construction of two-party computation protocols, in particular ones based on the approach of garbled circuits, is labor intensive and error-prone. The central contribution of the current paper is a tool which achieves Secure Two-Party Computation for ANSI C. Our work is based on a combination of model checking techniques and two-party computation based on garbled circuits. Our key insight is a nonstandard use of the bit-precise model checker CBMC which enables us to translate C programs into equivalent Boolean circuits. To this end, we modify the standard CBMC translation from programs into Boolean formulas whose variables correspond to the memory bits manipulated by the program. As CBMC attempts to minimize the size of the formulas, the circuits obtained by our tool chain are also size efficient; to improve the efficiency of the garbled circuit evaluation, we perform optimizations on the circuits. Experimental results with the new tool CBMC-GC demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach.},

To date, researchers have essentially taken a signal processing approach to GPS security and shown that GPS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. In this work, we systematically map out a larger attack surface by viewing GPS as a computer system. Our surface includes higher level GPS protocol messages than previous work, as well as the GPS OS and downstream dependent systems. We develop a new hardware platform for GPS attacks, and develop novel attacks against GPS infrastructure. Our experiments on consumer and professional-grade receivers show that GPS and GPS-dependent systems are significantly more vulnerable than previously thought. For example, we show that remote attacks via malicious GPS broadcasts are capable of bringing down up to 30{\{}{\%}{\}} and 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of the global CORS navigation and NTRIP networks, respectively, using hardware that costs about the same as a laptop. In order to improve security, we propose systems-level defenses and principles that can be deployed to secure critical GPS and dependent systems. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

For example, Amazon’s Elas- tic Compute Cloud (EC2), Microsoft Azure, Google’s Compute Engine, and Rackspace Hosting all offer Infrastructure as a Ser- vice (IaaS) solutions that pack multiple customer virtual machines (VMs) onto the same physical server. The gained efficiencies have some cost: past work has shown that the performance of one customer’s VMcan suffer due to inter- ference from another. In experiments on a local testbed, we found that the performance of a cache-sensitive benchmark can degrade by more than 80{\{}{\%}{\}} because of interference from another VM. This interference incentivizes a new class of attacks, that we call resource-freeing attacks (RFAs). The goal is to modify the work- load of a victim VM in a way that frees up resources for the at- tacker’s VM. We explore in depth a particular example of an RFA. Counter-intuitively, by adding load to a co-resident victim, the at- tack speeds up a class of cache-bound workloads. In a controlled lab setting we show that this can improve performance of synthetic benchmarks by up to 60{\{}{\%}{\}} over not running the attack. In the nois- ier setting of Amazon’s EC2, we still show improvements of up to 13{\{}{\%}{\}}.},

We propose a new, universally composable (UC) security definition for the two-server case (2PASS) in the public-key setting that addresses a number of relevant limitations of the previous, non-UC definition. For example, our definition makes no prior assumptions on the distribution of passwords, preserves security when honest users mistype their passwords, and guarantees secure composition with other protocols in spite of the unavoidable non-negligible success rate of online dictionary attacks. We further present a concrete 2PASS protocol and prove that it meets our definition. Given the strong security guarantees, our protocol is surprisingly efficient: in its most efficient instantiation under the DDH assumption in the random-oracle model, it requires fewer than twenty elliptic-curve exponentiations on the user's device. We achieve our results by careful protocol design and by exclusively focusing on the two-server public-key setting.},

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that even with a zero-length redundancy, Boneh's SAEP scheme (an OAEP-like construction with a single-round Feistel network rather than two) converts a trapdoor one-way permutation into an IND-CCA-secure scheme, provided the permutation satisfies two additional properties. We then prove that the Rabin function and RSA with short exponent enjoy these properties, and thus can be used to instantiate the construction we propose to obtain efficient encryption schemes. The reduction that justifies the security of our construction is tight enough to achieve practical security with reasonable key sizes.},

However, the presence of adversaries may ren- der the time stamp insecure, and it is crucial to understand the robustness of ENF analysis against anti-forensic opera- tions. This paper investigates possible anti-forensic opera- tions that can remove and alter the ENF signal while trying to preserve the host signal, and develops detection methods targeting these operations. Improvements over anti-forensic operations that can circumvent the detection are also exam- ined, for which various trade-offs are discussed. To develop an understanding of the dynamics between a forensic an- alyst and an adversary, an evolutionary perspective and a game-theoretical perspective are proposed, which allow for a comprehensive characterization of plausible anti-forensic strategies and countermeasures. Such an understanding has the potential to lead to more secure and reliable time stamp schemes based on ENF analysis. Categories},

abstract = {The mainstream approach to protecting the location-privacy of mobile users in location-based services (LBSs) is to alter the users' actual locations in order to reduce the location information exposed to the service provider. The location obfuscation algorithm behind an effective location-privacy preserving mechanism (LPPM) must consider three fundamental elements: the privacy requirements of the users, the adversary's knowledge and capabilities, and the maximal tolerated service quality degradation stemming from the obfuscation of true locations. We propose the first methodology, to the best of our knowledge, that enables a designer to find the optimal LPPM for a LBS given each user's service quality constraints against an adversary implementing the optimal inference algorithm. Such LPPM is the one that maximizes the expected distortion (error) that the optimal adversary incurs in reconstructing the actual location of a user, while fulfilling the user's service-quality requirement. We formalize the mutual optimization of user-adversary objectives (location privacy vs. correctness of localization) by using the framework of Stackelberg Bayesian games. In such setting, we develop two linear programs that output the best LPPM strategy and its corresponding optimal inference attack. Our optimal user-centric LPPM can be easily integrated in the users' mobile devices they use to access LBSs. We validate the efficacy of our game theoretic method against real location traces. Our evaluation confirms that the optimal LPPM strategy is superior to a straightforward obfuscation method, and that the optimal localization attack performs better compared to a Bayesian inference attack.},

abstract = {Due to their high practical impact, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks have attracted a lot of attention from the security community members. In the same way, a plethora of more or less effective defense techniques have been proposed, ad- dressing the causes and effects of XSS vulnerabilities. As a result, an adversary often can no longer inject or even execute arbitrary scripting code in several real-life scenarios. In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remains after XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mit- igated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScript code. We address the question of whether an attacker really needs JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacks aiming for information theft. The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML, inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive information from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrary data displayed on a given website. We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mit- igation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition, we have implemented a browser patch that enables a website to make a vital determination as to being loaded in a de- tached view or pop-up window. This approach proves useful for prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.},

abstract = {An enormous number of apps have been developed for Android in recent years, making it one of the most popular mobile operating systems. However, the quality of the booming apps can be a concern [4]. Poorly engineered apps may contain security vulnerabilities that can severally undermine users' security and privacy. In this paper, we study a general category of vulnerabilities found in Android apps, namely the component hijacking vulnerabilities. Several types of previously reported app vulnerabilities, such as permission leakage, unauthorized data access, intent spoofing, and etc., belong to this category. We propose CHEX, a static analysis method to automatically vet Android apps for component hijacking vulnerabilities. Modeling these vulnerabilities from a data-flow analysis perspective, CHEX analyzes Android apps and detects possible hijack-enabling flows by conducting low-overhead reachability tests on customized system dependence graphs. To tackle analysis challenges imposed by Android's special programming paradigm, we employ a novel technique to discover component entry points in their completeness and introduce app splitting to model the asynchronous executions of multiple entry points in an app. We prototyped CHEX based on Dalysis, a generic static analysis framework that we built to support many types of analysis on Android app bytecode. We evaluated CHEX with 5,486 real Android apps and found 254 potential component hijacking vulnerabilities. The median execution time of CHEX on an app is 37.02 seconds, which is fast enough to be used in very high volume app vetting and testing scenarios.},

abstract = {A workflow specification defines a set of steps and the order in which those steps must be executed. Security requirements may impose constraints on which groups of users are permitted to perform subsets of those steps. A workflow specification is said to be satisfiable if there exists an assignment of users to workflow steps that satisfies all the constraints. An algorithm for determining whether such an assignment exists is important, both as a static analysis tool for workflow specifications, and for the construction of run-time reference monitors for workflow management systems. Finding such an assignment is a hard problem in general, but work by Wang and Li in 2010 using the theory of parameterized complexity suggests that efficient algorithms exist under reasonable assumptions about workflow specifications. In this paper, we improve the complexity bounds for the workflow satisfiability problem. We also generalize and extend the types of constraints that may be defined in a workflow specification and prove that the satisfiability problem remains fixed-parameter tractable for such constraints.},

The most basic of these, privacy, suffices for two- party secure function evaluation (SFE) and private function evaluation (PFE). Starting from a PRF, we provide an efficient garbling scheme achieving privacy and we analyze its concrete security. We next consider obliviousness and authenticity, properties needed for private and verifiable outsourcing of computation. We extend our scheme to achieve these ends. We provide highly efficient blockcipher-based instantiations of both schemes. Our treatment of garbling schemes presages more efficient garbling, more rigorous analyses, and more modularly designed higher-level protocols.},

abstract = {Modern smartphone operating systems (OSs) have been developed with a greater emphasis on security and protecting privacy. One of the mechanisms these systems use to protect users is a permission system, which requires developers to declare what sensitive resources their applications will use, has users agree with this request when they install the application and constrains the application to the requested resources during runtime. As these permission systems become more common, questions have risen about their design and implementation. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the permission system of the Android smartphone OS in an attempt to begin answering some of these questions. Because the documentation of Android's permission system is incomplete and because we wanted to be able to analyze several versions of Android, we developed PScout, a tool that extracts the permission specification from the Android OS source code using static analysis. PScout overcomes several challenges, such as scalability due to Android's 3.4 million line code base, accounting for permission enforcement across processes due to Android's use of IPC, and abstracting Android's diverse permission checking mechanisms into a single primitive for analysis. We use PScout to analyze 4 versions of Android spanning version 2.2 up to the recently released Android 4.0. Our main findings are that while Android has over 75 permissions, there is little redundancy in the permission specification. However, if applications could be constrained to only use documented APIs, then about 22{\{}{\%}{\}} of the non-system permissions are actually unnecessary. Finally, we find that a trade-off exists between enabling least-privilege security with fine-grained permissions and maintaining stability of the permission specification as the Android OS evolves.},

We introduce the notion of risk scoring and risk ranking for Android apps, to improve risk communication for Android apps, and identify three desiderata for an effective risk scoring scheme. We propose to use probabilistic generative models for risk scoring schemes, and identify several such models, ranging from the simple Naive Bayes, to advanced hierarchical mixture models. Experimental results conducted using real-world datasets show that probabilistic general models significantly outperform existing approaches, and that Naive Bayes models give a promising risk scoring approach.},

Our results indicate that even state of the art virus scanners can not fully protect users from these threats. Moreover, we conducted a manual analysis, showing how many cracks and keygens actually work and how much effort is necessary to acquire them.

abstract = {Current approaches to security policy monitoring are based on linear control flow constraints such as runQuery may be evaluated only after sanitize. However, realistic security policies must be able to conveniently capture data flow con- straints as well. An example is a policy stating that argu- ments to the function runQuery must be either constants, outputs of a function sanitize, or concatenations of any such values. We present a novel approach to security policy monitor- ing that uses tree automata to capture constraints on the way data is processed along an execution. We present a $\lambda$-calculus based model of the framework, investigate some of the models meta-properties, and show how it can be im- plemented using labels corresponding to automaton states to reflect the computational histories of each data item. We show how a standard denotational semantics induces the ex- pected monitoring regime on a simple ”while” language. Fi- nally we implement the framework for the Dalvik VM using TaintDroid as the underlying data flow tracking mechanism, and evaluate its functionality and performance on five case studies.},

abstract = {The lucrative rewards of security penetrations into large organi- zations have motivated the development and use of many sophis- ticated rootkit techniques to maintain an attacker’s presence on a compromised system. Due to the evasive nature of such infections, detecting these rootkit infestations is a problem facing modern or- ganizations. While many approaches to this problem have been proposed, various drawbacks that range from signature generation issues, to coverage, to performance, prevent these approaches from being ideal solutions. In this paper, we present Blacksheep, a distributed system for detecting a rootkit infestation among groups of similar machines. This approach was motivated by the homogenous natures of many corporate networks. Taking advantage of the similarity amongst the machines that it analyses, Blacksheep is able to efficiently and effectively detect both existing and new infestations by comparing the memory dumps collected from each host. We evaluate Blacksheep on two sets of memory dumps. One set is taken from virtual machines using virtual machine introspec- tion, mimicking the deployment of Blacksheep on a cloud comput- ing provider’s network. The other set is taken from Windows XP machines via a memory acquisition driver, demonstrating Black- sheep’s usage under more challenging image acquisition condi- tions. The results of the evaluation show that by leveraging the homogeneous nature of groups of computers, it is possible to de- tect rootkit infestations.},

abstract = {Smart electric meters pose a substantial threat to the privacy of in- dividuals in their own homes. Combined with non-intrusive load monitors, smartmeter data can reveal precise home appliance usage information. An emerging solution to behavior leakage in smart meter measurement data is the use of battery-based load hiding. In this approach, a battery is used to store and supply power to home devices at strategic times to hide appliance loads fromsmartmeters. A few such battery control algorithms have already been studied in the literature, but none have been evaluated from an adversarial point of view. In this paper, we first consider two well known bat- tery privacy algorithms, Best Effort (BE) and Non-Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL), and demonstrate attacks that recover precise load change information, which can be used to recover appliance be- havior information, under both algorithms. We then introduce a stepping approach to battery privacy algorithms that fundamentally differs from previous approaches by maximizing the error between the load demanded by a home and the external load seen by a smart meter. By design, precise load change recovery attacks are impos- sible. We also propose mutual-information based measurements to evaluate the privacy of different algorithms. We implement and evaluate four novel algorithms using the stepping approach, and show that under the mutual-information metrics they outperform BE and NILL.},

abstract = {The Tor network is designed to provide users with low- latency anonymous communications. Tor clients build cir- cuits with publicly listed relays to anonymously reach their destinations. However, since the relays are publicly listed, they can be easily blocked by censoring adversaries. Con- sequently, the Tor project envisioned the possibility of un- listed entry points to the Tor network, commonly known as bridges. We address the issue of preventing censors from detecting the bridges by observing the communications be- tween them and nodes in their network. We propose amodel in which the client obfuscates its mes- sages to the bridge in a widely used protocol over the Inter- net. We investigate using Skype video calls as our target protocol and our goal is to make it difficult for the censor- ing adversary to distinguish between the obfuscated bridge connections and actual Skype calls using statistical compar- isons. We have implemented our model as a proof-of-concept pluggable transport for Tor, which is available under an open-source licence. Using this implementation we observed the obfuscated bridge communications and compared it with those of Skype calls and presented the results.},

We conduct a variety of experiments to evaluate DDoS attack and defense scenarios where one or more layers of defense mechanisms are deployed, and demonstrate that our framework sheds light on the interplay between decision makings of both the attacker and the defender, as well as how they affect the outcomes of DDoS attack and defense games.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system that relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to verify payments. Nowadays, Bitcoin is increasingly used in a number of fast payment scenarios, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of few seconds). While the Bitcoin payment verification scheme is designed to prevent double-spending, our results show that the system requires tens of minutes to verify a transaction and is therefore inappropriate for fast payments. An example of this use of Bitcoin was recently reported in the media: Bitcoins were used as a form of $\backslash$emph{\{}{\{}{\}}fast{\{}{\}}{\}} payment in a local fast-food restaurant. Until now, the security of fast Bitcoin payments has not been studied. In this paper, we analyze the security of using Bitcoin for fast payments. We show that, unless appropriate detection techniques are integrated in the current Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with overwhelming probability and can be mounted at low cost. We further show that the measures recommended by Bitcoin developers for the use of Bitcoin in fast payments are not always effective in detecting double-spending; we show that if those recommendations are integrated in future Bitcoin implementations, double-spending attacks on Bitcoin will still be possible. Finally, we propose and implement a modification to the existing Bitcoin implementation that ensures the detection of double-spending attacks against fast payments.},

abstract = {This paper examines historical releases of Sendmail, Post-fix, Apache httpd and OpenSSL by using static source code analysis and the entry-rate in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary (CVE) for a release, which we take as a measure of the rate of discovery of exploitable bugs. We show that the change in number and density of issues reported by the source code analyzer is indicative of the change in rate of discovery of exploitable bugs for new releases - formally we demonstrate a statistically significant correlation of moderate strength. The strength of the correlation is an artifact of other factors such as the degree of scrutiny: the number of security analysts investigating the software. This also demonstrates that static source code analysis can be used to make some assessment of risk even when constraints do not permit human review of the issues identified by the analysis. We find only a weak correlation between absolute values measured by the source code analyzer and rate of discovery of exploitable bugs, so in general it is unsafe to use absolute values of number of issues or issue densities to compare different applications or software. Our results demonstrate that software quality, as measured by the number of issues, issue density or number of exploitable bugs, does not always improve with each new release. However, generally the rate of discovery of exploitable bugs begins to drop three to five years after the initial release. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {JavaScript is used by web developers to enhance the inter- activity of their sites, offload work to the users’ browsers and improve their sites’ responsiveness and user-friendliness, making web pages feel and behave like traditional desk- top applications. An important feature of JavaScript, is the ability to combine multiple libraries from local and re- mote sources into the same page, under the same namespace. While this enables the creation of more advanced web ap- plications, it also allows for a malicious JavaScript provider to steal data from other scripts and from the page itself. Today, when developers include remote JavaScript libraries, they trust that the remote providers will not abuse the power bestowed upon them. In this paper, we report on a large-scale crawl ofmore than three million pages of the top 10,000 Alexa sites, and iden- tify the trust relationships of these sites with their library providers. We show the evolution of JavaScript inclusions over time and develop a set of metrics in order to assess the maintenance-quality of each JavaScript provider, showing that in some cases, top Internet sites trust remote providers that could be successfully compromised by determined at- tackers and subsequently serve malicious JavaScript. In this process, we identify four, previously unknown, types of vul- nerabilities that attackers could use to attack popular web sites. Lastly, we review some proposed ways of protecting a web application frommalicious remote scripts and show that some of them may not be as effective as previously thought.},

To evaluate the bene t of snoopbased monitoring, we also implemented similar SoC with a snapshot-based monitor to be compared with.

abstract = {Applications can be logically separated to parts that face different types of threats, or suffer dissimilar exposure to a particular threat because of external events or innate properties of the software. Based on this observation, we propose the virtual partitioning of applications that will allow the selective and targeted application of those protection mechanisms that are most needed on each par-tition, or manage an application's attack surface by protecting the most exposed partition. We demonstrate the value of our scheme by introducing a methodology to automatically partition software, based on the intrinsic property of user authentication. Our approach is able to automatically determine the point where users authen-ticate, without access to source code. At runtime, we employ a monitor that utilizes the identified authentication points, as well as events like accessing specific files, to partition execution and adapt defenses by switching between protection mechanisms of varied in-tensity, such as dynamic taint analysis and instruction-set random-ization. We evaluate our approach using seven well-known network applications, including the MySQL database server. Our results indicate that our methodology can accurately discover authentica-tion points. Furthermore, we show that using virtual partitioning to apply costly protection mechanisms can reduce performance over-head by up to 5x, depending on the nature of the application.},

abstract = {Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows a client to encrypt its data in such a way that this data can still be searched. The most immediate application of SSE is to cloud storage, where it enables a client to securely outsource its data to an untrusted cloud provider without sacrificing the ability to search over it. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nSSE has been the focus of active research and a multitude of schemes that achieve various levels of security and efficiency have been proposed. Any practical SSE scheme, however, should (at a minimum) satisfy the following properties: sublinear search time, security against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks, compact indexes and the ability to add and delete files efficiently. Unfortunately, none of the previously-known SSE constructions achieve all these properties at the same time. This severely limits the practical value of SSE and decreases its chance of deployment in real-world cloud storage systems. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nTo address this, we propose the first SSE scheme to satisfy all the properties outlined above. Our construction extends the inverted index approach (Curtmola et al., CCS 2006) in several non-trivial ways and introduces new techniques for the design of SSE. In addition, we implement our scheme and conduct a performance evaluation, showing that our approach is highly efficient and ready for deployment.},

Unfortunately, current protocols and implementations have$\backslash$ninherent limitations that are hard to overcome using standard and practical$\backslash$ntechniques. Among them are: (1) requiring participants to do work linear in$\backslash$nthe size of the circuit representation of the function; (2) requiring all$\backslash$nparties to do the same amount of work; and (3) not being able to provide$\backslash$ncomplete fairness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nA promising approach for overcoming these limitations is to augment the SFE$\backslash$nsetting with a small set of untrusted servers that have no input to the$\backslash$ncomputation and that receive no output, but that make their computational$\backslash$nresources available to the parties. In this model, referred to as$\backslash$nserver-aided SFE, the goal is to tradeoff the parties' work at the$\backslash$nexpense of the servers. Motivated by the emergence of public cloud services$\backslash$nsuch as Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure, recent work has explored the extent to$\backslash$nwhich server-aided SFE can be achieved with a single server.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn this work, we revisit the sever-aided setting from a practical perspective$\backslash$nand design single-server-aided SFE protocols that are considerably more$\backslash$nefficient than all previously-known protocols.

abstract = {Analyzing cryptographic implementations has important ap- plications, especially for malware analysis where they are an integral part both of the malware payload and the un- packing code that decrypts this payload. These implemen- tations are often based on well-known cryptographic func- tions, whose description is publicly available. While po- tentially very useful for malware analysis, the identification of such cryptographic primitives is made difficult by the fact that they are usually obfuscated. Current state-of-the- art identification tools are ineffective due to the absence of easily identifiable static features in obfuscated code. How- ever, these implementations still maintain the input-output (I/O) relationship of the original function. In this paper, we present a tool that leverages this fact to identify crypto- graphic functions in obfuscated programs, by retrieving their I/O parameters in an implementation-independent fashion, and comparing them with those of known cryptographic functions. In experimental evaluation, we successfully iden- tified the cryptographic functions TEA, RC4, AES andMD5 both in synthetic examples protected by a commercial-grade packer (AsProtect), and in several obfuscated malware sam- ples (Sality, Waledac, Storm Worm and SilentBanker). In addition, our tool was able to recognize basic operations done in asymmetric ciphers such as RSA.},

This attack is the first such attack demonstrated on a symmetric multiprocessing system virtualized using a modern VMM (Xen). Such systems are very common today, ranging from desktops that use virtualization to sandbox application or OS compromises, to clouds that co-locate the workloads of mutually distrustful customers. Constructing such a side-channel requires overcoming challenges including core migration, numerous sources of channel noise, and the difficulty of preempting the victim with sufficient frequency to extract fine-grained information from it.

The most ubiquitous method -- the password -- has numerous problems, including susceptibility to unintentional exposure via phishing and cross-site password reuse. Second-factor authentication schemes have the potential to increase security but face usability and deployability challenges. For example, conventional second-factor schemes change the user authentication experience. Furthermore, while more secure than passwords, second-factor schemes still fail to provide sufficient protection against (single-use) phishing attacks. We present PhoneAuth, a system intended to provide security assurances comparable to or greater than that of conventional two-factor authentication systems while offering the same authentication experience as traditional passwords alone. Our work leverages the following key insights. First, a user's personal device (eg a phone) can communicate directly with the user's computer (and hence the remote web server) without any interaction with the user. Second, it is possible to provide a layered approach to security, whereby a web server can enact different policies depending on whether or not the user's personal device is present. We describe and evaluate our server-side, Chromium web browser, and Android phone implementations of PhoneAuth.},

The same goes for key software applications such as web browsers or mail clients. As a consequence, a significant fraction of internet-connected computers is infected with malware. To mitigate this threat, we propose a combined approach of (1) a run-time security architecture that can efficiently protect fine-grained software modules executing on a standard operating system, and (2) a compiler that compiles standard C source code modules to such protected binary modules. The offered security guarantees are significant: relying on a TCB of only a few thousand lines of code, we show that the power of arbitrary kernel-level or process-level malware is reduced to interacting with the module through the module’s public API. With a proper API design and implementation, modules are fully protected. The run-time architecture can be loaded on demand and only incurs performance overhead when it is loaded. Benchmarks show that, once loaded, it incurs a 3.22{\{}{\%}{\}} system-wide performance cost. For applications that make intensive use of protected modules, and hence benefit most of the securit},

@article{Dijk2012,
abstract = {We consider the following challenge: How can a cloud storage provider prove to a tenant that it’s encrypting files at rest, when the provider itself holds the corresponding encryption keys? Such proofs demonstrate sound encryption policies and file confidentiality. (Cheating, cost-cutting, or miscon- figured providers may bypass the computation/management burdens of encryption and store plaintext only.) To address this problem, we propose hourglass schemes, protocols that prove correct encryption of files at rest by im- posing a resource requirement (e.g., time, storage or compu- tation) on the process of translating files from one encoding domain (i.e., plaintext) to a different, target domain (i.e., ciphertext). Our more practical hourglass schemes exploit common cloud infrastructure characteristics, such as limited file-system parallelism and the use of rotational hard drives for at-rest files. For files of modest size, we describe an hour- glass scheme that exploits trapdoor one-way permutations to prove correct file encryption whatever the underlying stor- age medium. We also experimentally validate the practicality of our proposed schemes, the fastest of which incurs minimal over- head beyond the cost of encryption. As we show, hourglass schemes can be used to verify properties other than correct encryption, e.g., embedding of “provenance tags” in files for tracing the source of leaked files. Of course, even if a provider is correctly storing a file as ciphertext, it could also store a plaintext copy to service tenant requests more efficiently. Hourglass schemes cannot guarantee ciphertext-only stor- age, a problem inherent when the cloud manages keys. By means of experiments in Amazon EC2, however, we demon- strate that hourglass schemes provide strong incentives for economically rational cloud providers against storage of ex- tra plaintext file copies.},

We first design a security definition for routing path vector protocols by studying, generalizing, and formalizing numerous known threats. Our model incorporates three major security goals. It is quite strong, yet simple to use. We prove by reduction that S-BGP satisfies two out of the security model's three goals, assuming the underlying signature scheme is secure. Under the same assumption, we next show how the protocol can be modified to meet all three security goals simultaneously. Finally, we study security of partial PKI deployment of path vector protocols when not all nodes have public keys. We investigate the possibilities of relaxing the PKI requirement and relying on the non-cryptographic physical security of the protocol in order to achieve possibly weaker, but still well-defined, notions of security. We also present the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve full security in the partial PKI deployment scenario. We believe our conclusions will prove useful for protocol developers, standards bodies and government agencies.},

We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unau- thorized access to the victim user’s profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer ex- amination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementa- tion simplicity.

In this regime, attackers pay for an exploit kit or service to do the “dirty work” of exploiting a victim’s browser, decoupling the complexities of browser and plugin vulnerabilities from the challenges of generating traffic to a web- site under the attacker’s control. Upon a successful exploit, these kits load and execute a binary provided by the attacker, effectively transferring control of a victim’s machine to the attacker. In order to understand the impact of the exploit-as-a-service paradigm on the malware ecosystem, we perform a detailed analysis of the prevalence of exploit kits, the families of malware installed upon a successful exploit, and the volume of traffic that malicious web sites receive. To carry out this study, we analyze 77,000 malicious URLs received from Google Safe Browsing, along with a crowd-sourced feed of blacklisted URLs known to direct to exploit kits. These URLs led to over 10,000 distinct binaries, which we ran in a contained environment. Our results show that many of the most prominent families of malware now propagate through driveby downloads—32 families in all. Their activities are supported by a handful of exploit kits, with Blackhole accounting for 29{\{}{\%}{\}} of all malicious URLs in our data, followed in popularity by Incognito.We use DNS traffic from real networks to provide a unique perspective on the popularity of malware families based on the frequency that their binaries are in- stalled by drivebys, as well as the lifetime and popularity of do- mains funneling users to exploits.},

abstract = {We extend Goldberg’s multi-server information-theoretic private information retrieval (PIR) with a suite of protocols for privacy-preserving e-commerce. Our first protocol adds support for single-payee tiered pricing, wherein users purchase database records without revealing the indices or prices of those records. Tiered pricing lets the seller set prices based on each user’s status within the system; e.g., non-members may pay full price while members may receive a discounted rate. We then extend tiered pricing to support group-based access control lists with record-level granularity; this allows the servers to set access rights based on users’ price tiers. Next, we show how to do some basic bookkeeping to implement a novel top-K replication strategy that enables the servers to construct bestsellers lists, which facilitate faster retrieval for these most popular records. Finally, we build on our bookkeeping functionality to support multiple payees, thus enabling several sellers to offer their digital goods through a common database while enabling the database servers to determine to what portion of revenues each seller is entitled. Our protocols maintain user anonymity in addition to query privacy; that is, queries do not leak information about the index or price of the record a user purchases, the price tier according to which the user pays, the user’s remaining balance, or even whether the user has ever queried the database before. No other priced PIR or oblivious transfer protocol supports tiered pricing, access control lists, multiple payees, or top-K replication, whereas ours supports all of these features while preserving PIR’s sublinear communication complexity. We have implemented our protocols as an add-on to Percy++, an open source implementation of Goldberg’s PIR scheme. Measurements indicate that our protocols are practical for deployment in real-world ecommerce applications.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel model of routing security that incorporates the ordinarily overlooked variations in trust that users have for different parts of the network. We focus on anonymous communication, and in particular onion routing, although we expect the approach to apply more broadly. This paper provides two main contributions. First, we present a novel model to consider the various security concerns for route selection in anonymity networks when users vary their trust over parts of the network. Second, to show the usefulness of our model, we present as an example a new algorithm to select paths in onion routing. We analyze its effectiveness against deanonymization and other information leaks, and particularly how it fares in our model versus existing algorithms, which do not consider trust. In contrast to those, we find that our trust-based routing strategy can protect anonymity against an adversary capable of attacking a significant fraction of the network.},

abstract = {SICE is a novel framework to provide hardware-level isola- tion and protection for sensitive workloads running on x86 platforms in compute clouds. Unlike existing isolation tech- niques, SICE does not rely on any software component in the host environment (i.e., an OS or a hypervisor). Instead, the security of the isolated environments is guaranteed by a trusted computing base that only includes the hardware, the BIOS, and the SystemManagementMode (SMM). SICE provides fast context switching to and from an isolated envi- ronment, allowing isolated workloads to time-share the phys- ical platform with untrusted workloads. Moreover, SICE supports a large range (up to 4GB) of isolated memory. Fi- nally, the most unique feature of SICE is the use of multi- core processors to allow the isolated environments to run concurrently and yet securely beside the untrusted host. We have implemented a SICE prototype using an AMD x86 hardware platform. Our experiments show that SICE performs fast context switching (67 µs) to and from the iso- lated environment and that it imposes a reasonable overhead (3{\{}{\%}{\}} on all but one benchmark) on the operation of an iso- lated Linux virtual machine. Our prototype demonstrates that, subject to a careful security review of the BIOS soft- ware and the SMM hardware implementation, current hard- ware architecture already provides abstractions that can sup- port building strong isolation mechanisms using a very small SMM software foundation of about 300 lines of code.},

In order to protect the intellectual property and to prevent fraud, e.g., by cloning an FPGA or manipulating its content, many current FPGAs employ a bitstream encryption feature. We develop a successful attack on the bitstream encryption engine integrated in the widespread Virtex-II Pro FPGAs from Xilinx, using side-channel analysis. After measuring the power consumption of a single power-up of the device and a modest amount of o -line computation, we are able to recover all three di erent keys used by its triple DES module. Our method allows extracting secret keys from any real-world device where the bitstream encryption feature of Virtex-II Pro is enabled. As a consequence, the target product can be cloned and manipulated at will of the attacker. Also, more advanced attacks such as reverse engineering or the introduction of hardware Trojans become potential threats. As part of the side-channel attack, we were able to deduce certain internals of the hardware encryption engine. To our knowledge, this is the rst attack against the bitstream encryption of a commercial FPGA reported in the open literature.},

abstract = {We present the design, implementation and evaluation of an algorithm that checks audit logs for compliance with privacy and security policies. The algorithm, which we name reduce, addresses two fundamental challenges in compliance checking that arise in practice. First, in order to be applicable to realistic policies, reduce operates on policies expressed in a first-order logic that allows restricted quantification over infinite domains. We build on ideas from logic programming to identify the restricted form of quantified formulas. The logic can, in particular, express all 84 disclosure-related clauses of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which involve quantification over the infinite set of messages containing personal information. Second, since audit logs are inherently incomplete (they may not contain sufficient information to determine whether a policy is violated or not), reduce proceeds iteratively: in each iteration, it provably checks as much of the policy as possible over the current log and outputs a residual policy that can only be checked when the log is extended with additional information. We prove correctness, termination, time and space complexity results for reduce. We implement reduce and optimize the base implementation using two heuristics for database indexing that are guided by the syntactic structure of policies. The implementation is used to check simulated audit logs for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Our experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is fast enough to be used in practice.},

Feature hashing also allows us to mine correlated features between malware families and samples using co-clustering techniques. Our evaluation shows that BitShred speeds up typical malware triage tasks by up to 2,365x and uses up to 82x less memory on a single CPU, all with comparable accuracy to previous approaches.

Recent work introduced predictive mitigation, a new way to mitigating leakage through timing channels; this mechanism works by predicting timing from past behavior, and then enforcing the predictions. This paper generalizes predictive mitigation to a larger and important class of systems: systems that receive input requests from multiple clients and deliver responses. The new insight is that timing predictions may be a function of any public information, rather than being a function simply of output events. Based on this insight, a more general mechanism and theory of predictive mitigation becomes possible. The result is that bounds on timing leakage can be tightened, achieving asymptotically logarithmic leakage under reasonable assumptions. By applying it to web applications, the generalized predictive mitigation mechanism is shown to be effective in practice.},

We combine these concepts into a general app isolation mechanism that can provide the same security benefits in a single browser. While not appropriate for all types of web sites, many sites with high-value user data can opt in to app isolation to gain defenses against a wide variety of browser-based attacks. We implement app isolation in the Chromium browser and verify its security properties using finite-state model checking. We also measure the performance overhead of app isolation and conduct a large-scale study to evaluate its adoption complexity for various types of sites, demonstrating how the app isolation mechanisms are suitable for protecting a number of high-value Web applications, such as online banking.},

Anonymous communication systems allow users to conceal the destinations they communicate with, but do not hide the fact that the users are using them. The mere use of such systems may invite suspicion, or access to them may be blocked. We therefore propose Cirripede, a system that can be used for unobservable communication with Internet destinations. Cirripede is designed to be deployed by ISPs; it intercepts connections fromclients to innocent-looking destinations and redirects them to the true destination requested by the client. The communication is encoded in a way that is indistinguishable from normal communications to anyone without the master secret key, while public-key cryptography is used to eliminate the need for any secret information that must be shared with Cirripede users. Cirripede is designed to work scalably with routers that handle large volumes of traffic while imposing minimal over- head on ISPs and not disrupting existing traffic. This allows Cirripede proxies to be strategically deployed at central locations, making access to Cirripede very difficult to block. We built a proof-of-concept implementation of Cirripede and performed a testbed evaluation of its performance proper- ties.},

We retrofit the Android operating system to implement these two controls for use with unmodified applications. A key challenge of imposing shadowing and exfiltration blocking on existing applications is that these controls could cause side effects that interfere with user-desired functionality. To measure the impact of side effects, we develop an automated testing methodology that records screenshots of application executions both with and without privacy controls, then automatically highlights the visual differences between the different executions. We evaluate our privacy controls on 50 applications from the Android Market, selected from those that were both popular and permission-hungry. We find that our privacy controls can successfully reduce the effective permissions of the application without causing side effects for 66{\{}{\%}{\}} of the tested applications.

In this paper we tackle a newly emerging and especially aggressive class of blackhat SEO, namely search poi- soning. Unlike other blackhat SEO techniques, which typically at- tempt to promote a website’s ranking only under a limited set of search keywords relevant to the website’s content, search poison- ing techniques disregard any term relevance constraint and are em- ployed to poison popular search keywords with the sole purpose of diverting large numbers of users to short-lived traffic-hungry web- sites for malicious purposes. To accurately detect search poisoning cases, we designed a novel detection system called SURF. SURF runs as a browser component to extract a number of robust (i.e., difficult to evade) detection fea- tures from search-then-visit browsing sessions, and is able to ac- curately classify malicious search user redirections resulted from user clicking on poisoned search results. Our evaluation on real- world search poisoning instances shows that SURF can achieve a detection rate of 99.1{\{}{\%}{\}} at a false positive rate of 0.9{\{}{\%}{\}}. Further- more, we applied SURF to analyze a large dataset of search-related browsing sessions collected over a period of seven months starting in September 2010. Through this long-term measurement study we were able to reveal new trends and interesting patterns related to a great variety of poisoning cases, thus contributing to a better un- derstanding of the prevalence and gravity of the search poisoning problem.},

We show that an adversary can decrypt a cipher- text by performing only 14 requests per plaintext byte on average. This poses a serious and truly practical security threat on all currently used implementations of XML En- cryption. In a sense the attack can be seen as a generalization of padding oracle attacks (Vaudenay, Eurocrypt 2002). It ex- ploits a subtle correlation between the block cipher mode of operation, the character encoding of encrypted text, and the response behaviour of aWeb Service if an XML message cannot be parsed correctly.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that an application with access to accelerometer readings on a modern mobile phone can use such information to recover text entered on a nearby keyboard. Note that unlike previous emana- tion recovery papers, the accelerometers on such devices sample at near the Nyquist rate, making previous techniques unworkable. Our application instead detects and decodes keystrokes by measur- ing the relative physical position and distance between each vibra- tion. We then match abstracted words against candidate dictionar- ies and record word recovery rates as high as 80{\{}{\%}{\}}. In so doing, we demonstrate the potential to recover significant information from the vicinity of a mobile device without gaining access to resources generally considered to be the most likely sources of leakage (e.g., microphone, camera).},

abstract = {In many software attacks, inducing an illegal control-flow transfer in the target system is one common step. Control- Flow Integrity (CFI [1]) protects a software system by enforcing a pre-determined control-flow graph. In addition to providing strong security, CFI enables static analysis on low-level code. This paper evaluates whether CFI-enabled static analysis can help build efficient and validated data sandboxing. Previous systems generally sandbox memory writes for integrity, but avoid protecting confidentiality due to the high overhead of sandboxing memory reads. To reduce overhead, we have implemented a series of optimizations that remove sandboxing instructions if they are proven unnecessary by static analysis. On top of CFI, our system adds only 2.7{\{}{\%}{\}} runtime overhead on SPECint2000 for sandboxing memory writes and adds modest 19{\{}{\%}{\}} for sandboxing both reads and writes. We have also built a principled data-sandboxing verifier based on range analysis. The verifier checks the safety of the results of the optimizer, which removes the need to trust the rewriter and optimizer. Our results show that the combination of CFI and static analysis has the potential of bringing down the cost of general inlined reference monitors, while maintaining strong security.},

abstract = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have put ubiquitous availability of fully sequenced human genomes within reach. It is no longer hard to imagine the day when everyone will have the means to obtain and store one's own DNA sequence. Widespread and affordable availability of fully sequenced genomes immediately opens up important opportunities in a number of health-related fields. In particular, common genomic applications and tests performed in vitro today will soon be conducted computationally, using digitized genomes. New applications will be developed as genome-enabled medicine becomes increasingly preventive and personalized. However, this progress also prompts significant privacy challenges associated with potential loss, theft, or misuse of genomic data. In this paper, we begin to address genomic privacy by focusing on three important applications: Paternity Tests, Personalized Medicine, and Genetic Compatibility Tests. After carefully analyzing these applications and their privacy requirements, we propose a set of efficient techniques based on private set operations. This allows us to implement in in silico some operations that are currently performed via in vitro methods, in a secure fashion. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed techniques are both feasible and practical today.},

abstract = {The smart grid introduces concerns for the loss of consumer privacy; recently deployed smart meters retain and distribute highly accurate profiles of home energy use. These profiles can be mined by Non Intrusive Load Monitors (NILMs) to expose much of the human activity within the served site. This paper introduces a new class of algorithms and systems, called Non Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL) to combat potential invasions of privacy. NILL uses an in-residence battery to mask variance in load on the grid, thus eliminating exposure of the appliance-driven information used to compromise consumer privacy. We use real residential energy use profiles to drive four simulated deployments of NILL. The simulations show that NILL exposes only 1.1 to 5.9 useful energy events per day hidden amongst hundreds or thousands of similar battery-suppressed events. Thus, the energy profiles exhibited by NILL are largely useless for current NILM algorithms. Surprisingly, such privacy gains can be achieved using battery systems whose storage capacity is far lower than the residence's aggregate load average. We conclude by discussing how the costs of NILL can be offset by energy savings under tiered energy schedules.},

abstract = {The emergence of cost-effective cloud services offers organizations great opportunity to reduce their cost and increase productivity. This development, however, is hampered by privacy concerns: a significant amount of organizational computing workload at least partially involves sensitive data and therefore cannot be directly outsourced to the public cloud. The scale of these computing tasks also renders existing secure outsourcing techniques less applicable. A natural solution is to split a task, keeping the computation on the private data within an organization’s private cloud while moving the rest to the public commercial cloud. However, this hybrid cloud computing is not supported by today’s data-intensive computing frameworks, MapReduce in particular, which forces the users to manually split their computing tasks. In this paper, we present a suite of new techniques that make such privacy-aware data-intensive computing possible. Our system, called Sedic, leverages the special features of MapReduce to automatically partition a computing job according to the security levels of the data it works on, and arrange the computation across a hybrid cloud. Specifically, we modified MapReduce’s distributed file system to strategically replicate data, moving sanitized data blocks to the public cloud. Over this data placement, map tasks are carefully scheduled to outsource as much workload to the public cloud as possible, given sensitive data always stay on the private cloud. To minimize inter-cloud communication, our approach also automatically analyzes and transforms the reduction structure of a submitted job to aggregate the map outcomes within the public cloud before sending the result back to the private cloud for the final reduction. This also allows the users to interact with our system in the same way they work with MapReduce, and directly run their legacy code in our framework. We implemented Sedic on Hadoop and evaluated it using both real and synthesized computing jobs on a large-scale cloud test-bed. The study shows that our techniques effectively protect sensitive user data, offload a large amount of computation to the public cloud and also fully preserve the scalability of MapReduce.},

abstract = {Verifying that access-control systems maintain desired security properties is recognized as an important problem in security. Enterprise access-control systems have grown to protect tens of thousands of resources, and there is a need for verification to scale commensurately. We present a new abstraction-refinement technique for automatically finding errors in Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) security policies. ARBAC is the first and most comprehensive administrative scheme for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. Underlying our approach is a change in mindset: we propose that error finding complements verification, can be more scalable, and allows for the use of a wider variety of techniques. In our approach, we use an abstraction-refinement technique to first identify and discard roles that are unlikely to be relevant to the verification question (the abstraction step), and then restore such abstracted roles incrementally (the refinement steps). Errors are one-sided: if there is an error in the abstracted policy, then there is an error in the original policy. If there is an error in a policy whose role-dependency graph diameter is smaller than a certain bound, then we find the error. Our abstraction-refinement technique complements conventional state-space exploration techniques such as model checking. We have implemented our technique in an access-control policy analysis tool. We show empirically that our tool scales well to realistic policies, and is orders of magnitude faster than prior tools.},

abstract = {OneSwarm is a system for anonymous p2p file sharing in use by thousands of peers. It aims to provide Onion Routing-like privacy and BitTorrent-like performance. We demonstrate several flaws in OneSwarm's design and implementation through three different attacks available to forensic investigators. First, we prove that the current design is vulnerable to a novel timing attack that allows just two attackers attached to the same target to determine if it is the source of queried content. When attackers comprise 15{\{}{\%}{\}} of OneSwarm peers, we expect over 90{\{}{\%}{\}} of remaining peers will be attached to two attackers and therefore vulnerable. Thwarting the attack increases OneSwarm query response times, making them longer than the equivalent in Onion Routing. Second, we show that OneSwarm's vulnerability to traffic analysis by colluding attackers is much greater than was previously reported, and is much worse than Onion Routing. We show for this second attack that when investigators comprise 25{\{}{\%}{\}} of peers, over 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of the network can be investigated with 80{\{}{\%}{\}} precision to find the sources of content. Our examination of the One-Swarm source code found differences with the technical paper that significantly reduce security. For the implementation in use by thousands of people, attackers that comprise 25{\{}{\%}{\}} of the network can successfully use this second attack against 98{\{}{\%}{\}} of remaining peers with 95{\{}{\%}{\}} precision. Finally, we show that a novel application of a known TCP-based attack allows a single attacker to identify whether a neighbor is the source of data or a proxy for it. Users that turn off the default rate-limit setting are exposed. Each attack can be repeated as investigators leave and rejoin the network. All of our attacks are successful in a forensics context: Law enforcement can use them legally ahead of a warrant. Furthermore, private investigators, who have fewer restrictions on their behavior, can use them more easily in pursuit of evidence for such civil suits as copyright infringement. © 2011 ACM.},

Third, run an existing protocol analyser (ProVerif) to prove security properties or find attacks. We formalise our algorithm and appeal to existing results for ProVerif to establish computational soundness under suitable circumstances.

abstract = {Computational soundness results show that under certain conditions it is possible to conclude computational security whenever symbolic security holds. Unfortunately, each soundness result is usually established for some set of cryptographic primitives and extending the result to encompass new primitives typically requires redoing most of the work. In this paper we suggest a way of getting around this problem. We propose a notion of computational soundness that we term deduction soundness. As for other soundness notions, our definition captures the idea that a computational adversary does not have any more power than a symbolic adversary. However, a key aspect of deduction soundness is that it considers, intrinsically, the use of the primitives in the presence of functions specified by the adversary. As a consequence, the resulting notion is amenable to modular extensions. We prove that a deduction sound implementation of some arbitrary primitives can be extended to include asymmetric encryption and public data-structures (e.g. pairings or list), without repeating the original proof effort. Furthermore, our notion of soundness concerns cryptographic primitives in a way that is independent of any protocol specification language. Nonetheless, we show that deduction soundness leads to computational soundness for languages (or protocols) that satisfy a so called commutation property.},

abstract = {Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images so far played a rather small role on the Internet, mainly due to the lack of proper browser support. Recently, things have changed: the W3C and WHATWG draft specifications for HTML5 require mod-ern web browsers to support SVG images to be embedded in a multitude of ways. Now SVG images can be embed-ded through the classical method via specific tags such as <embed> or <object>, or in novel ways, such as with <img> tags, CSS or inline in any HTML5 document. SVG files are generally considered to be plain images or animations, and security-wise, they are being treated as such (e.g., when an embedment of local or remote SVG images into websites or uploading these files into rich web appli-cations takes place). Unfortunately, this procedure poses great risks for the web applications and the users utilizing them, as it has been proven that SVG files must be consid-ered fully functional, one-file web applications potentially containing HTML, JavaScript, Flash, and other interactive code structures. We found that even more severe problems have resulted from the often improper handling of complex and maliciously prepared SVG files by the browsers. In this paper, we introduce several novel attack techniques targeted at major websites, as well as modern browsers, email clients and other comparable tools. In particular, we illustrate that SVG images embedded via <img> tag and CSS can execute arbitrary JavaScript code. We examine and present how current filtering techniques are circumventable by using SVG files and subsequently propose an approach to mitigate these risks. The paper showcases our research into the usage of SVG images as attack tools, and determines its impact on state-of-the-art web browsers such as Firefox 4, Internet Explorer 9, and Opera 11.},

In this paper, we investigate the requirements for successful GPS spoofing attacks on individuals and groups of victims with civilian or military GPS receivers. In particular, we are interested in identifying from which locations and with which precision the attacker needs to generate its signals in order to successfully spoof the receivers. We will show, for example, that any number of receivers can easily be spoofed to one arbitrary location; however, the attacker is restricted to only few transmission locations when spoofing a group of receivers while preserving their constellation. In addition, we investigate the practical aspects of a satellite-lock takeover, in which a victim receives spoofed signals after first being locked on to legitimate GPS signals. Using a civilian GPS signal generator, we perform a set of experiments and find the minimal precision of the attacker's spoofing signals required for covert satellite-lock takeover.},

Much has been written about the risks and benefits of cloud computing in the last years. The literature on clouds often points out security and privacy challenges as the main obstacles, and proposes solutions and guidelines to avoid them. However, most of these works deal with either malicious cloud providers or customers, but ignore the severe threats caused by unaware users. In this paper we consider security and privacy aspects of real-life cloud deployments, independently from malicious cloud providers or customers. We focus on the popular Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and give a detailed and systematic analysis of various crucial vulnerabilities in publicly available and widely used Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and show how to eliminate them. Our Amazon Image Attacks (AmazonIA) deploy an auto- mated tool that uses only publicly available interfaces and makes no assumptions on the underlying cloud infrastruc- ture. We were able to extract highly sensitive information (including passwords, keys, and credentials) from a variety of publicly available AMIs. The extracted information al- lows to (i) start (botnet) instances worth thousands of dol- lars per day, (ii) provide backdoors into the running ma- chines, (iii) launch impersonation attacks, or (iv) access the source code of the entire web service. Our attacks can be used to completely compromise several real web services of- fered by companies (including IT-security companies), e.g., for website statistics/user tracking, two-factor authentica- tion, or price comparison. Further, we show mechanisms to identify the AMI of certain running instances. Following the maxim “security and privacy by design”we show how our automated tools together with changes to the user interface can be used to mitigate our attacks.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is quickly becoming the platform of choice for many web services. Virtualization is the key underlying technology enabling cloud providers to host services for a large number of customers. Unfortunately, virtualization software is large, complex, and has a considerable attack surface. As such, it is prone to bugs and vulnerabilities that a malicious virtual machine (VM) can exploit to attack or obstruct other VMs -- a major concern for organizations wishing to move to the cloud. In contrast to previous work on hardening or minimizing the virtualization software, we eliminate the hypervisor attack surface by enabling the guest VMs to run natively on the underlying hardware while maintaining the ability to run multiple VMs concurrently. Our NoHype system embodies four key ideas: (i) pre-allocation of processor cores and memory resources, (ii) use of virtualized I/O devices, (iii) minor modifications to the guest OS to perform all system discovery during bootup, and (iv) avoiding indirection by bringing the guest virtual machine in more direct contact with the underlying hardware. Hence, no hypervisor is needed to allocate resources dynamically, emulate I/O devices, support system discovery after bootup, or map interrupts and other identifiers. NoHype capitalizes on the unique use model in cloud computing, where customers specify resource requirements ahead of time and providers offer a suite of guest OS kernels. Our system supports multiple tenants and capabilities commonly found in hosted cloud infrastructures. Our prototype utilizes Xen 4.0 to prepare the environment for guest VMs, and a slightly modified version of Linux 2.6 for the guest OS. Our evaluation with both SPEC and Apache benchmarks shows a roughly 1{\{}{\%}{\}} performance gain when running applications on NoHype compared to running them on top of Xen 4.0. Our security analysis shows that, while there are some minor limitations with cur- rent commodity hardware, NoHype is a significant advance in the security of cloud computing.},

abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems are faced with the challenge of identifying diverse attacks, in extremely high speed networks. For this reason, they must operate at multi-Gigabit speeds, while performing highly-complex per-packet and per-flow data processing. In this paper, we present a multi-parallel intrusion detection architecture tailored for high speed networks. To cope with the increased processing throughput requirements, our system parallelizes network traffic processing and analysis at three levels, using multi-queue NICs, multiple CPUs, and multiple GPUs. The proposed design avoids locking, optimizes data transfers between the different processing units, and speeds up data processing by mapping different operations to the processing units where they are best suited. Our experimental evaluation shows that our prototype implementation based on commodity off-the-shelf equipment can reach processing speeds of up to 5.2 Gbit/s with zero packet loss when analyzing traffic in a real network, whereas the pattern matching engine alone reaches speeds of up to 70 Gbit/s, which is an almost four times improvement over prior solutions that use specialized hardware.},

Access to privacy- and security-relevant parts of the API is controlled with an install-time application permis- sion system. We study Android applications to determine whether Android developers follow least privilege with their permission requests. We built Stowaway, a tool that detects overprivilege in compiled Android applications. Stowaway determines the set of API calls that an application uses and then maps those API calls to permissions. We used auto- mated testing tools on the Android API in order to build the permission map that is necessary for detecting overpriv- ilege. We apply Stowaway to a set of 940 applications and find that about one-third are overprivileged. We investigate the causes of overprivilege and find evidence that developers are trying to follow least privilege but sometimes fail due to insufficient API documentation:},

abstract = {We empirically analyzed sanitizer use in a shipping web ap- plication with over 400,000 lines of code and over 23,244 methods, the largest empirical analysis of sanitizer use of which we are aware. Our analysis reveals two novel classes of errors: context-mismatched sanitization and inconsistent multiple sanitization. Both of these arise not because sanitizers are incorrectly implemented, but rather because they are not placed in code correctly. Much of the work on crosssite scripting detection to date has focused on finding missing sanitizers in programs of average size. In large legacy applications, other sanitization issues leading to cross-site scripting emerge. To address these errors, we propose ScriptGard, a system for ASP.NET applications which can detect and repair the incorrect placement of sanitizers. ScriptGard serves both as a testing aid to developers as well as a runtime mitigation technique. While mitigations for cross site scripting attacks have seen intense prior research, we consider both server and browser context, none of them achieve the same degree of precision, and many other mitigation techniques require major changes to server side code or to browsers. Our approach, in contrast, can be incrementally retrofitted to legacy systems with no changes to the source code and no browser changes. With our optimizations, when used for mitigation, ScriptGard incurs virtually no statistically significant overhead.},

Because these devices can be linked to the movement of individuals, there is significant danger that the aggregate computation will violate the location privacy of individuals. This paper develops and evaluates PrivStats, a system for computing aggregate statistics over location data that simultaneously achieves two properties: first, provable guarantees on location privacy even in the face of any side information about users known to the server, and second, privacy-preserving accountability (i.e., protection against abusive clients uploading large amounts of spurious data). PrivStats achieves these properties using a new protocol for uploading and aggregating data anonymously as well as an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol we developed from scratch for accountability. We implemented our system on Nexus One smartphones and commodity servers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PrivStats is a practical system: computing a common aggregate (e.g., count) over the data of 10,000 clients takes less than 0.46 s at the server and the protocol has modest latency (0.6 s) to upload data from a Nexus phone. We also validated our protocols on real driver traces from the CarTel project.},

abstract = {Anonymity systems such as Tor aim to enable users to com- municate in a manner that is untraceable by adversaries that control a small number of machines. To provide efficient service to users, these anonymity systems make full use of forwarding capacity when sending traffic between interme- diate relays. In this paper, we show that doing this leaks in- formation about the set of Tor relays in a circuit (path). We present attacks that, with high confidence and based solely on throughput information, can (a) reduce the attacker’s un- certainty about the bottleneck relay of any Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed, (b) exactly identify the guard relay(s) of a Tor user when circuit throughput can be ob- served over multiple connections, and (c) identify whether two concurrent TCP connections belong to the same Tor user, breaking unlinkability. Our attacks are stealthy, and cannot be readily detected by a user or by Tor relays. We validate our attacks using experiments over the live Tor net- work. We find that the attacker can substantially reduce the entropy of a bottleneck relay distribution of a Tor cir- cuit whose throughput can be observed—the entropy gets reduced by a factor of 2 in the median case. Such in- formation leaks from a single Tor circuit can be combined over multiple connections to exactly identify a user’s guard relay(s). Finally, we are also able to link two connections from the same initiator with a crossover error rate of less than 1.5{\{}{\%}{\}} in under 5 minutes. Our attacks are also more accurate and require fewer resources than previous attacks on Tor. Categ},

Attackers exploit the resulting security vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the web appli-cation environment.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of a rela-tively unknown logic flaw in web applications, which we call Execution After Redirect, or EAR. A web application de-veloper can introduce an EAR by calling a redirect method under the assumption that execution will halt. A vulnera-bility occurs when server-side execution continues after the developers intended halting point, which can lead to bro-ken/insufficient access controls and information leakage. We start with an analysis of howsusceptible applications written in nine web frameworks are to EAR vulnerabilities. We then discuss the results from the EAR challenge contained within the 2010 International Capture the Flag Competition. Fi-nally, we present an open-source, white-box, static analysis tool to detect EARs in Ruby on Rails web applications. This tool found 3,944 EAR instances in 18,127 open-source appli-cations.

abstract = {This paper presents HyperSentry, a novel framework to enable integrity measurement of a running hypervisor (or any other highest privileged software layer on a system). Unlike existing solutions for protecting privileged software, HyperSentry does not introduce a higher privileged software layer below the integrity measurement target, which could start another race with malicious attackers in obtaining the highest privilege in the system. Instead, HyperSentry introduces a software component that is properly isolated from the hypervisor to enable stealthy and in-context measurement of the runtime integrity of the hypervisor. While stealthiness is necessary to ensure that a compromised hypervisor does not have a chance to hide the attack traces upon detecting an up-coming measurement, in-context measurement is necessary to retrieve all the needed inputs for a successful integrity measurement. HyperSentry uses an out-of-band channel (e.g., Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI), which is commonly available on server platforms) to trigger the stealthy measurement, and adopts the System Management Mode (SMM) to protect its base code and critical data. A key contribution of HyperSentry is the set of novel techniques that overcome SMM's limitation, providing an integrity measurement agent with (1) the same contextual information available to the hypervisor, (2) completely protected execution, and (3) attestation to its output. To evaluate HyperSentry, we implement a prototype of the framework along with an integrity measurement agent for the Xen hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation shows that HyperSentry is a low-overhead practical solution for real world systems.},

By correlating several attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone numbers, malware installed...), we discover that a few fraudsters are seemingly responsible for a majority of the scams, and evidence a number of loopholes these miscreants exploit. We further show that, while some of these sites may also be engaging in other illicit activities such as spamming, the connection between different types of scams is not as obvious as we initially expected. Last, we show that the rise in the number of these frauds is fueled by high expected monetary gains in return for very little risk.

More recent binary obfuscation techniques are divided in their purposes of attacking either statistical or semantic approach, but not both. In this paper, we introduce mimimorphism, a novel binary obfuscation technique with the potential of evading both statistical and semantic detections. Mimimorphic malware uses instruction-syntax-aware high-order mimic functions to transform its binary into mimicry executables that exhibit high similarity to benign programs in terms of statistical properties and semantic characteristics. We implement a prototype of the mimimorphic engine on the Intel x86 platform, and evaluate its capability of evading statistical anomaly detection and semantic analysis detection techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that the mimicry executables are indistinguishable from benign programs in terms of byte frequency distribution and entropy, as well as control flow fingerprint.},

Then we present a security analysis of the representative schemes we have identified. For the schemes that remain unbroken, we present our novel attacks. For the schemes for which known attacks are available, we propose a theoretical explanation why those schemes have failed. Next, we provide a simple but novel framework for guiding the design of robust IRCs. Then we propose an innovative IRC called Cortcha that is scalable to meet the requirements of large-scale applications. It relies on recognizing objects by exploiting the surrounding context, a task that humans can perform well but computers cannot. An infinite number of types of objects can be used to generate challenges, which can effectively disable the learning process in machine learning attacks. Cortcha does not require the images in its image database to be labeled. Image collection and CAPTCHA generation can be fully automated. Our usability studies indicate that, compared with Google's text CAPTCHA, Cortcha allows a slightly higher human accuracy rate but on average takes more time to solve a challenge.},

abstract = {Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single, large trusted computing base that contains security checks at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately, flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker to escape the security protections of the sandbox. In this work, we construct a Python-based sandbox that has a small, security-isolated kernel. Using a mechanism called a security layer, we migrate privileged functionality into memory-safe code on top of the sandbox kernel while retaining isolation. For example, significant portions of module import, file I/O, serialization, and network communication routines can be provided in security layers. By moving these routines out of the kernel, we prevent attackers from leveraging bugs in these routines to evade sandbox containment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by studying past bugs in Java's standard libraries and show that most of these bugs would likely be contained in our sandbox.},

abstract = {Models based on system calls are a popular and common approach to characterize the run-time behavior of programs. For example, system calls are used by intrusion detection systems to detect software exploits. As another example, policies based on system calls are used to sandbox applications or to enforce access control. Given that malware represents a significant security threat for today's computing infrastructure, it is not surprising that system calls were also proposed to distinguish between benign processes and malicious code. Most proposed malware detectors that use system calls follows program-centric analysis approach. That is, they build models based on specific behaviors of individual applications. Unfortunately, it is not clear how well these models generalize, especially when exposed to a diverse set of previously-unseen, real-world applications that operate on realistic inputs. This is particularly problematic as most previous work has used only a small set of programs to measure their technique's false positive rate. Moreover, these programs were run for a short time, often by the authors themselves. In this paper, we study the diversity of system calls by performing a large-scale collection (compared to previous efforts) of system calls on hosts that run applications for regular users on actual inputs. Our analysis of the data demonstrates that simple malware detectors, such as those based on system call sequences, face significant challenges in such environments. To address the limitations of program-centric approaches, we propose an alternative detection model that characterizes the general interactions between benign programs and the operating system (OS). More precisely, our system-centric approach models the way in which benign programs access OS resources (such as files and registry entries). Our experiments demonstrate that this approach captures well the behavior of benign programs and raises very few (even zero) false positives while being able to detect a significant fraction of today's malware.},

abstract = {A web application is a "two-part" program, with its components deployed both in the browser and in the web server. The communication between these two components inevitably leaks out the program's internal states to those eavesdropping on its web traffic, simply through the side channel features of the communication such as packet length and timing, even if the traffic is entirely encrypted. Our recent study shows that such side-channel leaks are both fundamental and realistic: a set of popular web applications are found to disclose highly sensitive user data such as one's family incomes, health profiles, investment secrets and more through their side channels. Our study also shows that an significant improvement of the current web-application development practice is necessary to mitigate this threat. To answer this urgent call, we present in this paper a suite of new techniques for automatic detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web applications. Our approach, called Sidebuster, can automatically analyze an application's source code to detect its side channels and then perform a rerun test to assess the amount of information disclosed through such channels (quantified as the entropy loss). Sidebuster has been designed to work on event-driven applications and can effectively handle the AJAX GUI widgets used in most web applications. In our research, we implemented a prototype of our technique for analyzing GWT applications and evaluated it using complicated web applications. Our study shows that Sidebuster can effectively identify the side-channel leaks in these applications and assess their severity, with a small overhead.},

abstract = {Secure "pairing" of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band (OOB) - audio, visual or tactile - communication is a well-established research direction. Lack of good quality interfaces on or physical access to certain constrained devices (e.g., headsets, access points, medical implants) makes pairing a challenging problem in practice. Prior work shows that pairing of constrained devices based on authenticated OOB (A-OOB) channels can be prone to human errors that eventually translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. An alternative and more usable solution is to use OOB channel(s) that are authenticated as well as secret (AS-OOB). AS-OOB pairing can be achieved by simply transmitting the key or a short password over the AS-OOB channel, avoiding potential serious human errors. A higher level goal of this paper is to analyze the security of AS-OOB pairing. More specifically, we take a closer look at three notable prior AS-OOB pairing proposals and challenge the direct or indirect assumption upon which the security of these proposals relies, i.e., the secrecy of underlying or associated audio channels. The first proposal (IMD Pairing [9]) uses a low frequency audio channel to pair an implanted RFID tag with an external reader. The second proposal (PIN-Vibra [20]) uses an automated vibrational channel to pair a mobile phone with a personal RFID tag. The third proposal (BEDA [22]) uses vibration (or blinking) on one device and manually synchronized button pressing on the other device. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of eavesdropping over acoustic emanations associated with these methods. Based on our results, we conclude that these methods provide a weaker level of security compared to what was originally assumed or is desired for the pairing operation.},

abstract = {Increasing attention has recently been given to the formal verification of the source code of cryptographic protocols. The standard approach is to use symbolic abstractions of cryptography that make the analysis amenable to automation. This leaves the possibility of attacks that exploit the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms themselves. In this paper, we show how to conduct the protocol analysis on the source code level (F{\{}{\#}{\}} in our case) in a computationally sound way, i.e., taking into account cryptographic security definitions. We build upon the prominent F7 verification framework (Bengtson et al., CSF 2008) which comprises a security typechecker for F{\{}{\#}{\}} protocol implementations using symbolic idealizations and the concurrent lambda calculus RCF to model a core fragment of F{\{}{\#}{\}}. To leverage this prior work, we give conditions under which symbolic security of RCF programs using cryptographic idealizations implies computational security of the same programs using cryptographic algorithms. Combined with F7, this yields a computationally sound, automated verification of F{\{}{\#}{\}} code containing public-key encryptions and signatures. For the actual computational soundness proof, we use the CoSP framework (Backes, Hofheinz, and Unruh, CCS 2009). We thus inherit the modularity of CoSP, which allows for easily extending our proof to other cryptographic primitives. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {Digital wireless radios broadcast identification numbers that uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed, given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the ability to track individuals' movements. The ability to use wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed and developed in to useful products. In these systems a user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identifiers to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve different levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the first quantitative support for the number and conditions of tracking devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence that a small, but not insignificant, number of mobile devices can be used to track a majority of users during a significant fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude that in the immediate future, malnets would require relatively high infection rates to pose a significant threat, but that voluntary networks, with perceived benefit can probably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of accuracy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of 802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by malnets},

abstract = {For the most part, forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we tend to lack detailed information just when we need it the most. Simply put, the current state of computer forensics leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real- world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromised has been detected.},

Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a PUF, our attacks construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. This algorithm can subsequently impersonate the PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. This breaks the security of essentially all applications and protocols that are based on the respective PUF. The PUFs we attacked successfully include standard Arbited PUFs and Ring Oscillator PUFs of arbitrary sizes, and XO Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs of up to a given size and complexity. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression and Evolution Strategies.

abstract = {The ability to locate random relays is a key challenge for peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication systems. Earlier attempts like Salsa and AP3 used distributes hash table lookups to locate relays, but the lack of anonymity in their lookup mechanisms enables an adversary to infer the path structure and compromise used anonymity. NISAN and Torsk are state-of-the-art systems for P2P anonymous communication. Their designs include mechanisms that are specifically tailored to mitigate information leak attacks. NISAN proposes to add anonymity into the lookup mechanism itself, while Torsk proposes the use of secret buddy nodes to anonymize the lookup initiator. In this paper, we attack the key mechanisms that hide the relationship between a lookup initiator and its selected relays in NISAN and Torsk. We present passive attacks on the NISAN lookup and show that it is not as anonymous as previously thought. We analyze three circuit construction mechanisms for anonymous communication using the NISAN lookup, and show that the information leaks in the NISAN lookup lead to a significant reduction in user anonymity. We also propose active attacks on Torsk that defeat its secret buddy mechanism and consequently compromise user anonymity. Our results are backed up by probabilistic modeling and extensive simulations. Our study motivates the search for a DHT lookup mechanism that is both secure and anonymous.},

To address this threat, we present a browser independent operating system kernel extension designed to eliminate driveby malware installations. The BLADE (Block All Drive-by download Exploits) system asserts that all executable files delivered through browser downloads must result from explicit user consent and transparently redirects every unconsented browser download into a nonexecutable secure zone of disk. BLADE thwarts the ability of browser-based exploits to surreptitiously download and execute malicious content by remapping to the file system only those browser downloads to which a programmatically inferred user-consent is correlated, BLADE provides its protection without explicit knowledge of any exploits and is thus resilient against code obfuscation and zero-day threats that directly contribute to the pervasiveness of today's drive-by malware. We present the design of our BLADE prototype implementation for the Microsoft Windows platform, and report results from as extensive empirical evaluation of its effectiveness on popular browsers. Our evaluation includes multiple versions of IE and Firefox, against 1,934 active malicious URLs, representing a broad spectrum of web-based exploits not plaguing the Internet.

For example, the main purpose of a MAC can be regarded as transforming an insecure into an authenticated channel, and encryption then corresponds to transforming an authenticated into a fully secure channel; this is the well-known Encrypt-then-Authenticate (EtA) paradigm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn the dual paradigm, Authenticate-then-Encrypt (AtE), encryption first transforms an insecure into a confidential channel, and a MAC transforms this into a secure channel. As pointed out by Bellare and Namprempre, and Krawczyk, there are encryption schemes for which AtE does not achieve the expected guarantees.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe highlight two reasons for investigating nevertheless AtE as a general paradigm: First, this calls for a definition of confidentiality; what separates a confidential from a secure channel is its (potential) malleability. We propose the first systematic analysis of malleability for symmetric encryption, which, in particular, allows us to state a generic condition on encryption schemes to be sufficient for AtE. Second, AtE is used in practice, for example in TLS. We show that the schemes used in TLS (stream ciphers and CBC encryption) satisfy the condition. This is consistent with Krawczyk's results on similar instantiations of AtE in game-based models.},

We introduce a new technique, stitched dynamic symbolic execution, that makes it possible to use exploration techniques based on symbolic execution in the presence of functionalities that are common in malware and otherwise hard to analyze, such as decryption and checksums. The technique is based on decomposing the constraints induced by a program, solving only a subset, and then re-stitching the constraint solution into a complete input. We implement the approach in a system for x86 binaries, and apply it to 4 prevalent families of bots and other malware. We find 6 bugs that could be exploited by a network attacker to terminate or subvert the malware. These bugs have persisted across malware revisions for months, and even years. We discuss the possible applications and ethical considerations of this new capability},

abstract = {Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the proto- col. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides. In this paper, we therefore propose a new, widely applicable def- inition of accountability, with interpretations both in symbolic and computational models. Our definition reveals that accountability is closely related to verifiability, for which we also propose a new definition. We prove that verifiability can be interpreted as a re- stricted form of accountability. Our findings on verifiability are of independent interest. As a proof of concept, we apply our definitions to the analy- sis of protocols for three different tasks: contract-signing, voting, and auctions. Our analysis unveils some subtleties and unexpected weaknesses, showing in one case that the protocol is unusable in practice. However, for this protocol we propose a fix to establish a reasonable level of accountability.},

abstract = {We construct an algebraic pseudorandom function (PRF) that is more efficient than the classic Naor-Reingold algebraic PRF. Our PRF is the result of adapting the cascade construction, which is the basis of HMAC, to the algebraic settings. To do so we define an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisfies a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efficient large-domain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

@article{Prasad2010,
abstract = {Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using electronic voting machines developed over the past two decades by a pair of government-owned companies. These devices, known in India as EVMs, have been praised for their simple design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently they have also been criticized following widespread reports of election irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the machines’ design have never been publicly disclosed, and they have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We describe the machine’s design and operation in detail, and we evaluate its security in light of relevant election procedures. We conclude that in spite of the machines’ simplicity and minimal software trusted computing base, they are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two attacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines. This case study carries important lessons for Indian elections and for electronic voting security more generally.},
